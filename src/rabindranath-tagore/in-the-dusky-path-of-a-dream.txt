IN the dusky path of a dream I went to seek the love who was mine in a former life
Her house stood at the end of a desolate street
In the evening breeze her pet peacock sat drowsing on its perch and the pigeons were silent in their corner
She set her lamp down by the portal and stood before me
She raised her large eyes to my face and mutely asked 'Are you well my friend?'
I tried to answer but our language had been lost and forgotten
I thought and thought our names would not come to my mind
Tears shone in her eyes She held up her right hand to me I took it and stood silent
Our lamp had flickered in the evening breeze and died
