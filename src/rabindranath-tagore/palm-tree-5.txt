Palm-tree single-legged giant
topping other trees
peering at the firmament 
It longs to pierce the black cloud-ceiling
and fly away away
if only it had wings
The tree seems to express its wish
in the tossing of its head
its fronds heave and swish 
It thinks Maybe my leaves are feathers
and nothing stops me now
from rising on their flutter
All day the fronds the windblown tree
soar and flap and shudder
as though it thinks it can fly
As though it wanders in the skies
travelling who knows where
wheeling past the stars 
And then as soon as the wind dies down
the fronds subside subside
the mind of the tree returns
To earth recalls that earth is its mother
and then it likes once more
its earthly corner
