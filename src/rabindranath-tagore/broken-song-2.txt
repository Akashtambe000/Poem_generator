Kasinath the new young singer fills the hall with sound
The seven notes dance in his throat like seven tame birds
His voice is a sharp sword slicing and thrusting everywhere
It darts like lightening  no knowing where it will go when
He sets deadly traps for himself then cuts them away
The courtiers listen in amazement give frequent gasps of praise
Only the old king Pratap Ray sits like wood unmoved
Haraj Lal is the only singer he likes all others leave him cold
From childhood he has spent so long listening to him sing 
Rag Kafi during holi cloud-songs during the rains
Songs for Durga at dawn in autumn songs to bid her farewell 
His heart swelled when he heard them and his eyes swam with tears
And on days when friends gathered and filled the hall
There were cowherds' songs of Krsna in raags Bhupali and Multan
So many nights of wedding-festivity have passed in that royal house
Servants dressed in red hundreds of lamps alight
The bridegroom sitting shyly in his finery and jewels
Young friends teasing him and whispering in his ear
Before him singing raag Sahana sits Baraj Lal
The king's heart is full of all those days and songs
When he hears some other singer he feels no chord inside
No sudden magical awakening of memories of the past
When Pratap Ray watches Kasinath he just sees his wagging head
Tune after tune after tune bu none with any echo in the heart
Kasinath asks for a rest and the singing stops for a space
Pratap Ray smilingly turns his eyes to Baraj Lal
He puts his mouth to his ear and says 'Dear ustad
Give us a song as songs ought to be this is no song at all
It's all tricks and games like a cat hunting a bird
We used to hear songs in the old days today they have no idea.'
Old Baraj Lal white-haired white turban on his head
Bows to the assembled courtiers and slowly takes his seat
He takes the tanpura in his wasted heavily veined hand
And with lowered head and closed eyes begins raag Yaman-kalyap
His quavering voice is swallowed by the enormous hall
Is like a tiny bird in a storm unable to fly for all it tries
Pratap Ray sitting to the left encourages him again and again
'Superb bravo!' he says in his ear 'sing out loud.'
The courtiers are inattentive some whisper amongst themselves
Some of them yawn some doze some go off to their rooms
Some of them call to servants 'Bring the bookah bring some pan.'
Some fan themselves furiously and complain of the heat
They cannot keep still for a minute they shuffle or walk about 
The hall was quiet before but every sort of noise has grown
The old man's singing is swamped like a frail boat in a typhoon
Only his shaky fingering of the tanpura shows it is there
Music that should rise on its own joy from the depths of the heart
Is crushed by heedless clamour like a fountain under a stone
The song and Baraj Lal's feelings go separate ways
But he sings for all he is worth to keep up the honour of his king
One of the verses of the song has somehow slipped from his mind
He quickly goes back tries to get it right this time
Again he forgets it is lost he shakes his head at the shame
He starts the song at the beginning  again he has to stop
His hand trembles doubly as he prays to his teachers name
His voice quakes with distress like a lamp guttering in a breeze
He abandons the words of the song and tries to salvage the tune
But suddenly his wide-mouthed singing breaks into loud cries
The intricate melody goes to the winds the rhythm is swept away 
Tears snap the thread of the song cascade like pearls
In shame he rests his head on the old tanpura in his lap 
He has failed to remember a song he weeps as he did as a child
With brimming eyes king Pratap Ray tenderly touches his friend
'Come let us go from here,' he says with kindness and love
They leave that festive hall with its hundreds of blinding lights
The two old friends go outside holding each other's hands
Baraj says with hands clasped 'Master our days are gone
New men have come now new styles and customs in the world
The court we kept is deserted  only the two of us are left
Don't ask anyone to listen to me now I beg you at your feet my lord
The singer along does not make a song there has to be someone who hears
One man opens his throat to sing the other sings in his mind
Only when waves fall on the shore do they make a harmonious sound
Only when breezes shake the woods do we hear a rustling in the leaves
Only from a marriage of two forces does music arise in the world
Where there is no love where listeners are dumb there never can be song.'
