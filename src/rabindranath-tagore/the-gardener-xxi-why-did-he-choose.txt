Why did he choose to come to my
door the wandering youth when the
day dawned
As I come in and out I pass by him
every time and my eyes are caught by
his face
I know not if I should speak to him
or keep silent Why did he choose to
come to my door
The cloudy nights in July are dark
the sky is soft blue in the autumn the
spring days are restless with the south
wind
He weaves his songs with fresh
tunes every time
I turn from my work and my eyes
fill with the mist Why did he choose
to come to my door
