Things throng and laugh loud in the sky the sands and dust dance
and whirl like children Man's mind is aroused by their shouts his
thoughts long to be the playmates of things
Our dreams drifting in the stream of the vague stretch their
arms to clutch the earth their efforts stiffen into bricks and
stones and thus the city of man is built
Voices come swarming from the past,-seeking answers from the
living moments Beats of their wings fill the air with tremulous
shadows and sleepless thoughts in our minds leave their nests to
take flight across the desert of dimness in the passionate thirst
for forms They are lampless pilgrims seeking the shore of light
to find themselves in things They will be lured into poets's
rhymes they will be housed in the towers of the town not yet
planned they have their call to arms from the battle fields of the
future they are bidden to join hands in the strife of peace yet
to come
