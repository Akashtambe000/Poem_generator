Take back your coins King's Councillor I am of those women you
sent to the forest shrine to decoy the young ascetic who had never
seen a women I failed in your bidding
Dimly day was breaking when the hermit boy came to bathe in
the stream his tawny locks crowded on his shoulders like a
cluster of morning clouds and his limbs shining like a streak of
sunbeam We laughed and sang as we rowed in our boat we jumped
into the river in a mad frolic and danced around him when the sun
rose staring at us from the water's edge in a flush of divine
anger
Like a child-god the boy opened his eyes and watched our
movements the wonder deepening till his eyes shone like morning
stars He lifted his clasped hands and chanted a hymn of praise in
his bird-like young voice thrilling every leaf of the forest
Never such words were sung to a mortal woman before they were like
the silent hymn to the dawn which rises from the hushed hills THe
women hid their mouths with their hands their bodies swaying with
laughter and a spasm of doubt ran across his face Quickly came
I to his side sorely pained and bowing to his feet I said
"Lord accept my service."
I led him to the grassy bank wiped his body with the end of
my silken mantle and kneeling on the ground I dried his feet
with my trailing hair When I raised my face and looked into his
eyes I thought I felt the world's first kiss to the first woman
Blessed am I blessed is God who made me a woman I heard him say
to me "What God unknown are you YOur touch is the touch of the
Immortal your eyes have the mystery of the midnight."
Ah no not that smile King's Councillor the dust of
worldly wisdom has covered your sight old man But this boy's
innocence pierced the mist and saw the shining truth the woman
divine
The women clapped their hands and laughed their obscene
laugh and with veils dragged on the dust and hair hanging loose
they began to pelt him with flowers
Alas my spotless sun could not my shame weave fiery mist to
cover you in its folds I fell at his feet and cried "Forgive me
" I fled like a stricken deer through shade and sun and cried as
I fled " Forgive me " The women's foul laughter pressed me like
a cracking fire but the words ever rang in my ears " What God
unknown are you?"
