The 'I' that floats along the wave of time
From a distance I watch him
With the dust and the water
With the fruit and the flower
With the All he is rushing forward
He is always on the surface
Tossed by the waves and dancing to the rhythm
Of joy and suffering
The least loss makes him suffer
The least wound hurts him
Him I see from afar
That 'I' is not my real self
I am still within myself
I do not float in the stream of death
I am free I am desireless
I am peace I am illumined
Him I see from afar
