I plucked your flower O world
I pressed it to my heart and the
thorn pricked
When the day waned and it
darkened I found that the flower had
faded but the pain remained
More flowers will come to you with
perfume and pride O world
But my time for flower-gathering
is over and through the dark night
I have not my rose only the pain
remains
