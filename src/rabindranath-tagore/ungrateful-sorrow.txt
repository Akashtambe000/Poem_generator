At dawn shey departed
My mind tried to console me 
' Everything is Maya'
Angrily I replied
'Here's this sewing box on the table
that flower-pot on the terrace
this monogrammed hand-fan on the bed 
all these are real.'
My mind said 'Yet think again.'
I rejoined ' You better stop
Look at this storybook
the hairpin halfway amongst its leaves
signaling the rest is unread
if all these things are 'Maya'
then why should 'shey' be more unreal '
My mind becomes silent
A friend arrived and says
'That which is good is real
it is never non-existent
entire world preserves and cherishes it its chest
like a precious jewel in a necklace.'
I replied in anger 'How do you know
Is a body not good Where did that body go '
Like a small boy in a rage hitting his mother
I began to strike at everything in this world
that gave me shelter
And I screamed:' The world is treacherous.'
Suddenly I was startled
It seemed like someone admonished me:' You ungrateful '
I looked at the crescent moon
hidden behind the tamarisk tree outside my window
As if the dear departed one is smiling
and playing hide-and-seek with me
From the depth of darkness punctuated by scattered stars
came a rebuke 'when I let you grasp me you call it an deception
and yet when I remain concealed
why do you hold on to your faith in me with such conviction '
