I only said "When in the evening the round full moon gets
entangled among the beaches of that Dadam tree couldn't somebody
catch it?"
But dada laughed at me and said "Baby you are the silliest
child I have ever known The moon is ever so far from us how could
anybody catch it?"
I said "Dada how foolish you are When mother looks out of
her window and smiles down at us playing would you call her far
away?"
Still dada said "You are a stupid child But baby where
could you find a net big enough to catch the moon with?"
I said "Surely you could catch it with your hands."
But dada laughed and said "You are the silliest child I have
known If it came nearer you would see how big the moon is."
I said "Dada what nonsense they teach at your school When
mother bends her face down to kiss us does her face look very
big?"
But still dada says "You are a stupid child."
