51
YOUR idol is shattered in the dust
to prove that God's dust is greater than
your idol
52
MAN does not reveal himself in his history
he struggles up through it
53
WHILE the glass lamp rebukes the earthen for calling it cousin
the moon rises and the glass lamp
with a bland smile calls her
'My dear dear sister.'
54
LIKE the meeting of the seagulls
and the waves we meet and come near
The seagulls fly off
the waves roll away and we depart
55
MY day is done
and I am like a boat drawn on the beach
listening to the dance-music of t
he tide in the evening
56
LIFE is given to us
we earn it by giving it
57
WE come nearest to the great
when we are great in humility
58
THE sparrow is sorry for the peacock
at the burden of its tail
59
NEVER be afraid of the moments
thus sings the voice of the everlasting
60
THE hurricane seeks the shortest road
by the no-road
and suddenly ends its search in the Nowhere
