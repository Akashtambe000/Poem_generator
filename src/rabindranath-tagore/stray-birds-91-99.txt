91
THE great earth makes herself hospitable
with the help of the grass
92
THE birth and death of the leaves
are the rapid whirls of the eddy
whose wider circles
move slowly among stars
93
POWER said to the world 'You are mine
The world kept it prisoner on her throne
Love said to the world 'I am thine.'
The world gave it the freedom of her house
94
THE mist is like the earth's desire
It hides the sun for whom she cries
95
BE still
my heart
these great trees are prayers
96
THE noise of the moment
scoffs at the music of the Eternal
97
I THINK of other ages
that floated upon the stream of life
and love and death and are forgotten
and I feel the freedom of passing away
98
THE sadness of my soul is her bride's veil
It waits to be lifted in the night
99
DEATH'S stamp gives value to the coin of life
making it possible to buy with life what is truly precious
