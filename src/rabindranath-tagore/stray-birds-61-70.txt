TAKE my wine in my own cup friend
It loses its wreath of foam
when poured into that of others
62
THE Perfect decks itself in beauty
for the love of the Imperfect
63
GOD says to man
'I heal you therefore I hurt
love you therefore punish.'
64
THANK the flame for its light
but do not forget the lampholder
standing in the shade with constancy of patience
65
TINY grass
your steps are small
but you possess the earth under your tread
66
THE infant flower opens its bud and cries
'Dear World please do not fade.'
67
GOD grows weary of great kingdoms
but never of little flowers
68
WRONG cannot afford defeat
but Right can
69
'I GIVE my whole water in joy
' sings the waterfall
'though little of it is enough for the thirsty.'
70
WHERE is the fountain
that throws up these flowers
in a ceaseless outbreak of ecstasy
