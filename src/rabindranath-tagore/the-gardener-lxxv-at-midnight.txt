At midnight the would-be ascetic
announced
"This is the time to give up my
home and seek for God Ah who has
held me so long in delusion here?"
God whispered "I," but the ears
of the man were stopped
With a baby asleep at her breast
lay his wife peacefully sleeping on
one side of the bed
The man said "Who are ye that
have fooled me so long?"
The voice said again "They are
God," but he heard it not
The baby cried out in its dream
nestling close to its mother
God commanded "Stop fool leave
not thy home," but still he heard not
God sighed and complained "Why
does my servant wander to seek me
forsaking me?"
