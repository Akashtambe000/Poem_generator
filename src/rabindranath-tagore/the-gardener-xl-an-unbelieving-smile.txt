An unbelieving smile flits on your
eyes when I come to you to take my
leave
I have done it so often that you
think I will soon return
To tell you the truth I have the
same doubt in my mind
For the spring days come again
time after time the full moon takes
leave and comes on another visit
the flowers come again and blush
upon their branches year after year
and it is likely that I take my leave
only to come to you again
But keep the illusion awhile do
not send it away with ungentle
haste
When I say I leave you for all
time accept it as true and let a
mist of tears for one moment deepen
the dark rim of your eyes
Then smile as archly as you like
when I come again
