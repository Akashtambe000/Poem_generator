O mad superbly drunk
If you kick open your doors and
play the fool in public
If you empty your bag in a night
and snap your fingers at prudence
If you walk in curious paths and
play with useless things
Reck not rhyme or reason
If unfurling your sails before the
storm you snap the rudder in two
Then I will follow you comrade
and be drunken and go to the dogs
I have wasted my days and nights
in the company of steady wise neighbours
Much knowing has turned my hair
grey and much watching has made
my sight dim
For years I have gathered and
heaped up scraps and fragments of
things
Crush them and dance upon them
and scatter them all to the winds
For I know 'tis the height of wisdom
to be drunken and go the dogs
Let all crooked scruples vanish
let me hopelessly lose my way
Let a gust of wild giddiness come
and sweep me away from my anchors
The world is peopled with worthies
and workers useful and clever
There are men who are easily first
and men who come decently after
Let them be happy and prosper
and let me be foolishly futile
For I know 'tis the end of all works
to be drunken and go to the dogs
I swear to surrender this moment
all claims to the ranks of the decent
I let go my pride of learning and
judgment of right and of wrong
I'll shatter memory's vessel scattering
the last drop of tears
With the foam of the berry-red
wine I will bathe and brighten my
laughter
The badge of the civil and staid
I'll tear into shreds for the nonce
I'll take the holy vow to be worthless
to be drunken and go to the dogs
