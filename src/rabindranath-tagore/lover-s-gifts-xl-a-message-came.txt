A message came from my youth of vanished days saying " I wait for
you among the quivering of unborn May where smiles ripen for tears
and hours ache with songs unsung."
It says "Come to me across the worn-out track of age through
the gates of death For dreams fade hopes fail the fathered
fruits of the year decay but I am the eternal truth and you shall
meet me again and again in your voyage of life from shore to
shore."
