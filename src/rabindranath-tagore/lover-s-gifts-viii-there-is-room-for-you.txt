There is room for you You are alone with your few sheaves of rice
My boat is crowded it is heavily laden but how can I turn you
away Your young body is slim and swaying there is a twinkling
smile in the edge of your eyes and your robe is coloured like the
rain cloud
The travellers will land for different roads and homes You
will sit for a while on the prow of my boat and at the journey's
end none will keep you back
Where do you go and to what home to garner your sheaves I
will not question you but when I fold my sails and moor my boat
I shall sit and wonder in the evening Where do you go and to
what home to garner your sheaves
