I have made You the polar star of my
existence never again can I lose my way in the
voyage of life
Wherever I go You are always there to
shower your benefience all around me Your face
is ever present before my mind's eyes
If I lose sight of You even for a moment I
almost lose my mind
Whenever my heart is about to go astray just
a glance of You makes it feel ashamed of itself
