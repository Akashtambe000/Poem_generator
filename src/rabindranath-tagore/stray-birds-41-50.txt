THE trees
like the longings of the earth
stand a-tiptoe to peep at the heaven
42
YOU smiled and talked to me of nothing
and I felt that for this I had been waiting long
43
THE fish in the water is silent
the animal on the earth is noisy
the bird in the air is singing
But Man has in him
the silence of the sea
the noise of the earth
and the music of the air
44
THE world rushes on
over the strings of the lingering heart
making the music of sadness
45
HE has made his weapons his gods
When his weapons win he is defeated himself
46
GOD finds himself by creating
47
SHADOW
with her veil drawn
follows Light in secret meekness
with her silent steps of
love
48
THE stars
are not afraid to appear like fireflies
49
I THANK thee that I am none of the wheels of power
but I am one with the living creatures
that are crushed by it
50
THE mind
sharp but not broad
sticks at every point
but does not move
