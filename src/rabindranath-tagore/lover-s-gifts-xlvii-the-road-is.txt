The road is my wedded companion She speaks to me under my feet all
day she sings to my dreams all night
My meeting with her had no beginning it begins endlessly at
each daybreak renewing its summer in fresh flowers and songs and
her every new kiss is the first kiss to me
The road and I are lovers I change my dress for her night
after night leaving the tattered cumber of the old in the wayside
inns when the day dawns
