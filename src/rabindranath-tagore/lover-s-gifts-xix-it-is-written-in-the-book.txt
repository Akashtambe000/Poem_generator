It is written in the book that Man when fifty must leave the
noisy world to go to the forest seclusion But the poet proclaims
that the forest hermitage is only for the young For it is the
birthplace of flowers and the haunt of birds and bees and hidden
hooks are waiting there for the thrill of lovers' whispers There
the moon-light that is all one kiss for the malati flowers has
its deep message but those who understand it are far below fifty
And alas youth is inexperienced and wilful therefore it is
but meet that the old should take charge of the household and the
young take to the seclusion of forest shades and the severe
discipline of courting
