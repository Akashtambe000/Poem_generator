I spent my day on the scorching
hot dust of the road
Now in the cool of the evening I
knock at the door of the inn It is
deserted and in ruins
A grim ashath tree spreads its
hungry clutching roots through the
gaping fissures of the walls
Days have been when wayfarers
came here to wash their weary feet
They spread their mats in the
courtyard in the dim light of the
early moon and sat and talked of
strange lands
They woke refreshed in the morning
when birds made them glad and
friendly flowers nodded their heads
at them from the wayside
But no lighted lamp awaited me
when I came here
The black smudges of smoke left by
many a forgotten evening lamp stare
like blind eyes from the wall
Fireflies flit in the bush near the
dried-up pond and bamboo branches
fling their shadows on the grass
grown path
I am the guest of no one at the end
of my day
The long night is before me and I
am tired
