I was walking by the road I do not
know why when the noonday was past
and bamboo branches rustled in the
wind
The prone shadows with their out
stretched arms clung to the feet of
the hurrying light
The koels were weary of their
songs
I was walking by the road I do not
know why
The hut by the side of the water is
shaded by an overhanging tree
Some on was busy with her work
and her bangles made music in the
corner
I stood before this hut I know not
why
The narrow winding road crosses
many a mustard field and many a
mango forest
It passes by the temple of the
village and the market at the river
landing-place
I stopped by this hut I do not know
why
Years ago it was a day of breezy
March when the murmur of the spring
was languorous and mango blossoms
were dropping on the dust
The rippling water leapt and licked
the brass vessel that stood on the
landing-step
I think of that day of breezy March
I do not know why
Shadows are deepening and cattle
returning to their folds
The light is grey upon the lonely
meadows and the villagers are waiting
for the ferry at the bank
I slowly return upon my steps I
do not know why
