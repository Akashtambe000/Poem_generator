Why do you whisper so faintly in
my ears O Death my Death
When the flowers droop in the
evening and cattle come back to their
stalls you stealthily come to my side
and speak words that I do not
understand
Is this how you must woo and win
me with the opiate of drowsy murmur
and cold kisses O Death my Death
Will there be no proud ceremony
for our wedding
Will you not tie up with a wreath
your tawny coiled locks
Is there none to carry your banner
before you and will not the night be
on fire with your red torch-lights
O Death my Death
Come with your conch-shells sound
ing come in the sleepless night
Dress me with a crimson mantle
grasp my hand and take me
Let your chariot be ready at my
door with your horses neighing impatiently
Raise my veil and look at my face
proudly O Death my Death
