There is a looker-on who sits behind my eyes I seems he has seen
things in ages and worlds beyond memory's shore and those
forgotten sights glisten on the grass and shiver on the leaves He
has seen under new veils the face of the one beloved in twilight
hours of many a nameless star Therefore his sky seems to ache with
the pain of countless meetings and partings and a longing pervades
this spring breeze the longing that is full of the whisper of
ages without beginning
