To the guests that must go bid
God's speed and brush away all traces
of their steps
Take to your bosom with a smile
what is easy and simple and near
To-day is the festival of phantoms
that know not when they die
Let your laughter be but a meaning
less mirth like twinkles of light on
the ripples
Let your life lightly dance on the
edges of Time like dew on the tip of
a leaf
Strike in chords from your harp
fitful momentary rhythms
