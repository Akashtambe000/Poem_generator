Are you a mere picture and not as true as those stars true as
this dust They throb with the pulse of things but you are
immensely aloof in your stillness painted form
The day was when you walked with me your breath warm your
limbs singing of life My world found its speech in your voice and
touched my heart with your face You suddenly stopped in your walk
in the shadow-side of the Forever and I went on alone
Life like a child laughs shaking its rattle of death as it
runs it beckons me on I follow the unseen but you stand there
where you stopped behind that dust and those stars and you are a
mere picture
No it cannot be Had the life-flood utterly stopped in you
it would stop the river in its flow and the foot-fall of dawn in
her cadence of colours Had the glimmering dusk of your hair
vanished in the hopeless dark the woodland shade of summer would
die with its dreams
Can it be true that I forgot you We haste on without heed
forgetting the flowers on the roadside hedge Yet they breathe
unaware into our forgetfulness filling it with music You have
moved from my world to take seat at the root of my life and
therefore is this forgetting-remembrance lost in its own depth
You are no longer before my songs but one with them You came
to me with the first ray of dawn I lost you with the last gold of
evening Ever since I am always finding you through the dark No
you are no mere picture
