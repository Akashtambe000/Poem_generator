She is near to my heart as the meadow-flower to the earth she is
sweet to me as sleep is to tired limbs My love for her is my life
flowing in its fullness like a river in autumn flood running with
serene abandonment My songs are one with my love like the murmur
of a stream that sings with all its waves and current
