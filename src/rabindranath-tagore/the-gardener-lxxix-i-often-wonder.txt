I often wonder where lie hidden
the boundaries of recognition between
man and the beast whose heart knows
no spoken language
Through what primal paradise in a
remote morning of creation ran the
simple path by which their hearts
visited each other
Those marks of their constant tread
have not been effaced though their
kinship has been long forgotten
Yet suddenly in some wordless
music the dim memory wakes up
and the beast gazes into the man's
face with a tender trust and the
man looks down into its eyes with
amused affection
It seems that the two friends meet
masked and vaguely know each other
through the disguise
