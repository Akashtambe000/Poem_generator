I wonder if I know him
In whose speech is my voice
In whose movement is my being
Whose skill is in my lines
Whose melody is in my songs
In joy and sorrow
I thought he was chained within me
Contained by tears and laughter
Work and play
I thought he was my very self
Coming to an end with my death
Why then in a flood of joy do I feel him
In the sight and touch of my beloved
This 'I' beyond self I found
On the shores of the shining sea
Therefore I know
This 'I' is not imprisoned within my bounds
Losing myself I find him
Beyond the borders of time and space
Through the Ages
I come to know his Shining Self
In the life of the seeker
In the voice of the poet
From the dark clouds pour the rains
I sit and think
Bearing so many forms so many names
I come down crossing the threshold
Of countless births and deaths
The Supreme undivided complete in himself
Embracing past and present
Dwells in Man
Within Him I shall find myself 
The 'I' that reaches everywhere
