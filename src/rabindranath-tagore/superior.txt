Mother your baby is silly She is so absurdly childish
She does not know the difference between the lights in the
streets and the stars
When we play at eating with pebbles she thinks they are real
food and tries to put them into her mouth
When I open a book before her and ask her to learn her a b
c she tears the leaves with her hands and roars for joy at
nothing this is your baby's way of doing her lesson
When I shake my head at her in anger and scold her and call
her naughty she laughs and thinks it great fun
Everybody knows that father is away but if in play I call
aloud "Father," she looks about her in excitement and thinks that
father is near
When I hold my class with the donkeys that our washer man
brings to carry away the clothes and I warn her that I am the
schoolmaster she will scream for no reason and call me dada
Your baby wants to catch the moon She is so funny she calls
Ganesh Ganush
Mother your baby is silly She is so absurdly childish
