Say of him what you please but I know my child's failings
I do not love him because he is good but because he is my
little child
How should you know how dear he can be when you try to weigh
his merits against his faults
When I must punish him he becomes all the more a part of my
being
When I cause his tears to come my heart weeps with him
I alone have a right to blame and punish for he only may
chastise who loves
