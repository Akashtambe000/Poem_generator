I dreamt that she sat by my head tenderly ruffling my hair with
her fingers playing the melody of her touch I looked at her face
and struggled with my tears till the agony of unspoken words burst
my sleep like a bubble
I sat up and saw the glow of the Milky Way above my window
like a world of silence on fire and I wondered if at this moment
she had a dream that rhymed with mine
