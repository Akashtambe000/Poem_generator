"What comes from your willing
hands I take I beg for nothing
more."
"Yes yes I know you modest
mendicant you ask for all that one
has."
"If there be a stray flower for me
I will wear it in my heart."
"But if there be thorns?"
"I will endure them."
"Yes yes I know you modest
mendicant you ask for all that one
has."
"If but once you should raise your
loving eyes to my face it would make
my life sweet beyond death."
"But if there be only cruel
glances?"
"I will keep them piercing my
heart."
"Yes yes I know you modest
mendicant you ask for all that one
has."
