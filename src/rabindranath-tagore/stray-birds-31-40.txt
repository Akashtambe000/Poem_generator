31
THE trees come up to my window
like the yearning voice of the dumb earth
32
HIS own mornings are new surprises to God
33
LIFE finds its wealth by the claims of the world
and its worth by the claims of love
34
THE dry river-bed finds no thanks for its past
35
THE bird wishes it were a cloud
The cloud wishes it were a bird
36
THE waterfall sings
'I find my song
when I find my freedom.'
37
I CANNOT tell why this heart languishes in silence
It is for small needs it never asks
or knows or remembers
38
WOMAN
when you move about in your household service
your limbs sing like a hill stream among its pebbles
39
THE sun goes to cross the Western sea
leaving its last salutation to the East
40
DO not blame your food because you have no appetite
