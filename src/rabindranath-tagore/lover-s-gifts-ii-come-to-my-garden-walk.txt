Come to my garden walk my love Pass by the fervid flowers that
press themselves on your sight Pass them by stopping at some
chance joy which like a sudden wonder of sunset illumines yet
elude
For lover's gift is shy it never tells its name it flits
across the shade spreading a shiver of joy along the dust
Overtake it or miss it for ever But a gift that can be
grasped is merely a frail flower or a lamp with flame that will
flicker
