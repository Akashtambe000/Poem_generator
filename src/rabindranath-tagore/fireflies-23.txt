My fancies are fireflies 
Specks of living light
twinkling in the dark
The voice of wayside pansies
that do not attract the careless glance
murmurs in these desultory lines
In the drowsy dark caves of the mind
dreams build their nest with fragments
dropped from day's caravan
Spring scatters the petals of flowers
that are not for the fruits of the future
but for the moment's whim
Joy freed from the bond of earth's slumber
rushes into numberless leaves
and dances in the air for a day
My words that are slight
may lightly dance upon time's waves
when my works heavy with import have gone down
Mind's underground moths
grow filmy wings
and take a farewell flight
in the sunset sky
The butterfly counts not months but moments
and has time enough
My thoughts like spark ride on winged surprises
carrying a single laughter
The tree gazes in love at its own beautiful shadow
which yet it never can grasp
Let my love like sunlight surround you
and yet give you illumined freedom
Days are coloured bubbles
that float upon the surface of fathomless night
My offerings are too timid to claim your remembrance
and therefore you may remember them
Leave out my name from the gift
if it be a burden
but keep my song
April like a child
writes hieroglyphs on dust with flowers
wipes them away and forgets
Memory the priestess
kills the present
and offers its heart to the shrine of the dead past
From the solemn gloom of the temple
children run out to sit in the dust
God watches them play
and forgets the priest
My mind starts up at some flash
on the flow of its thoughts
like a brook at a sudden liquid note of its own
that is never repeated
In the mountain stillness surges up
to explore its own height
in the lake movement stands still
to contemplate its own depth
The departing night's one kiss
on the closed eyes of morning
glows in the star of dawn
Maiden thy beauty is like a fruit
which is yet to mature
tense with an unyielding secret
Sorrow that has lost its memory
is like the dumb dark hours
that have no bird songs
but only the cricket's chirp
Bigotry tries to keep truth safe in its hand
with a grip that kills it
Wishing to hearten a timid lamp
great night lights all her stars
Though he holds in his arms the earth-bride
the sky is ever immensely away
God seeks comrades and claims love
the Devil seeks slaves and claims obedience
The soil in return for her service
keeps the tree tied to her
the sky asks nothing and leaves it free
Jewel-like immortal
does not boast of its length of years
but of the scintillating point of its moment
The child ever dwells in the mystery of ageless time
unobscured by the dust of history
Alight laughter in the steps of creation
carries it swiftly across time
One who was distant came near to me in the morning
and still nearer when taken away by night
White and pink oleanders meet
and make merry in different dialects
When peace is active sweeping its dirt it is storm
The lake lies low by the hill
a tearful entreaty of love
at the foot of the inflexible
There smiles the Divine Child
among his playthings of unmeaning clouds
and ephemeral lights and shadows
The breeze whispers to the lotus
'What is thy secret '
'It is myself,' says the lotus
'Steal it and I disappear '
The freedom of the storm and the bondage of the stem
join hands in the dance of swaying branches
The jasmine's lisping of love to the sun is her flowers
The tyrant claims freedom to kill freedom
and yet to keep it for himself
Gods tired of their paradise envy man
Clouds are hills in vapour
hills are clouds in stone 
a phantasy in time's dream
While God waits for His temple to be built of love
men bring stones
I touch God in my song
as the hill touches the far-away sea
with its waterfall
Light finds her treasure of colours
through the antagonism of clouds
My heart to-day smiles at its past night of tears
like a wet tree glistening in the sun
after the rain is over
I have thanked the trees that have made my life fruitful
but have failed to remember the grass
that has ever kept it green
The one without second is emptiness
the other one makes it true
Life's errors cry for the merciful beauty
that can modulate their isolation
into a harmony with the whole
They expect thanks for the banished nest
because their cage is shapely and secure
In love I pay my endless debt to thee
for what thou art
The pond sends up its lyrics from its dark in lilies
and the sun says they are good
Your calumny against the great is impious
it hurts yourself
against the small it is mean
for it hurts the victim
The first flower that blossomed on this earth
was an invitation to the unborn song
Dawn—the many-coloured flower—fades
and then the simple light-fruit
the sun appears
The muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom
throttles the voice that would cry
The wind tries to take the flame by storm
only to blow it out
Life's play is swift
Life's playthings fall behind one by one
and are forgotten
My flower seek not thy paradise
in a fool's buttonhole
Thou hast risen late my crescent moon
but my night bird is still awake to greet thee
Darkness is the veiled bride
silently waiting for the errant light
to return to her bosom
Trees are the earth's endless effort to
speak to the listening heaven
The burden of self is lightened
when I laugh at myself
The weak can be terrible
because they try furiously to appear strong
The wind of heaven blows
The anchor desperately clutches the mud
and my boat is beating its breast against the chain
The spirit of death is one
the spirit of life is many
When God is dead religion becomes one
The blue of the sky longs for the earth's green
the wind between them sighs 'Alas.'
Day's pain muffled by its own glare
burns among stars in the night
The stars crowd round the virgin night
in silent awe at her loneliness
that can never be touched
The cloud gives all its gold
to the departing sun
and greets the rising moon
with only a pale smile
He who does good comes to the temple gate
he who loves reaches the shrine
Flower have pity for the worm
it is not a bee
its love is a blunder and a burden
With the ruins of terror's triumph
children build their doll's house
The lamp waits through the long day of neglect
for the flame's kiss in the night
Feathers in the dust lying lazily content
have forgotten their sky
The flowers which is single
need not envy the thorns
that are numerous
The world suffers most from the disinterested tyranny
of its well-wisher
We gain freedom when we have paid the full price
for our right to live
Your careless gifts of a moment
like the meteors of an autumn night
catch fire in the depth of my being
The faith waiting in the heart of a seed
promises a miracle of life
which it cannot prove at once
Spring hesitates at winter's door
but the mango blossom rashly runs out to him
before her time and meets her doom
The world is the ever-changing foam
that floats on the surface of a sea of silence
The two separated shores mingle their voices
in a song of unfathomed tears
As a river in the sea
work finds its fulfilment
in the depth of leisure
I lingered on my way till thy cherry tree lost its blossom
but the azalea brings to me my love thy forgiveness
Thy shy little pomegranate bud
blushing to-day behind her veil
will burst into a passionate flower
to-morrow when I am away
The clumsiness of power spoils the key
and uses the pickaxe
Birth is from the mystery of night
into the greater mystery of day
These paper boats of mine are meant to dance
on the ripples of hours
and not to reach any destination
Migratory songs wing from my heart
and seek their nests in your voice of love
The sea of danger doubt and denial
around man's little island of certainty
challenges him to dare the unknown
Love punishes when it forgives
and injured beauty by its awful silence
You live alone and unrecompensed
because they are afraid of your great worth
The same sun is newly born in new lands
in a ring of endless dawns
God is world is ever renewed by death
a Titan's ever crushed by its own existence
The glow-worm while exploring the dust
never knows that stars are in the sky
The tree is of to-day the flower is old
it brings with it the message
of the immemorial seed
Each rose that comes brings me greetings
from the Rose of an eternal spring
God honours me when I work
He loves me when I sing
My love of to-day finds no home
in the nest deserted by yesterday's love
The fire of pain traces for my soul
a luminous path across her sorrow
The grass survives the hill
through its resurrections from countless deaths
Thou hast vanished from my reach
leaving an impalpable touch in the blue of the sky
an invisible image in the wind moving
among the shadows
In pity for the desolate branch
spring leaves to it a kiss that fluttered in a lonely leaf
The shy shadow in the garden
loves the sun in silence
Flowers guess the secret and smile
while the leaves whisper
I leave no trace of wings in the air
but I am glad I have had my flight
The fireflies twinkling among leaves
make the stars wonder
The mountain remains unmoved
at its seeming defeat by the mist
While the rose said to the sun
'I shall ever remember thee,'
her petals fell to the dust
Hills are the earth's gesture of despair
for the unreachable
Though the thorn in thy flower pricked me
O Beauty
I am grateful
The world knows that the few
are more than the many
Let not my love be a burden on you my friend
know that it pays itself
Dawn plays her lute before the gate of darkness
and is content to vanish when the sun comes out
Beauty is truth's smile
when she beholds her own face
in a perfect mirror
The dew-drop knows the sun
only within its own tiny orb
Forlorn thoughts from the forsaken lives of all ages
swarming in the air hum round my heart
and seek my voice
The desert is imprisoned in the wall
of its unbounded barrenness
In the thrill of little leaves
I see the air's invisible dance
and in their glimmering
the secret heart-beats of the sky
You are like a flowering tree
amazed when I praise you for your gifts
The earth's sacrificial fire
flames up in her trees
scattering sparks in flowers
Forests the clouds of earth
hold up to the sky their silence
and clouds from above come down
in resonant showers
The world speaks to me in pictures
my soul answers in music
The sky tells its beads all night
on the countless stars
in memory of the sun
The darkness of night like pain is dumb
the darkness of dawn like peace is silent
Pride engraves his frowns in stones
love offers her surrender in flowers
The obsequious brush curtails truth
in deference to the canvas which is narrow
The hill in its longing for the far-away sky
wishes to be like the cloud
with its endless urge of seeking
To justify their own spilling of ink
they spell the day as night
Profit smiles on goodness
when the good is profitable
In its swelling pride
the bubble doubts the truth of the sea
and laughs and bursts into emptiness
Love is an endless mystery
for it has nothing else to explain it
My clouds sorrowing in the dark
forget that they themselves
have hidden the sun
Man discovers his own wealth
when God comes to ask gifts of him
You leave your memory as a flame
to my lonely lamp of separation
I came to offer thee a flower
but thou must have all my garden,
It is thine
The picture—a memory of light
treasured by the shadow
It is easy to make faces at the sun
He is exposed by his own light in all
directions
History slowly smothers its truth
but hastily struggles to revive it
in the terrible penance of pain
My work is rewarded in daily wages
I wait for my final value in love
Beauty knows to say 'Enough,'
barbarism clamours for still more
God loves to see in me not his servant
but himself who serves all
The darkness of night is in harmony with day
the morning of mist is discordant
In the bounteous time of roses love is wine,
it is food in the famished hour
when their petals are shed
An unknown flower in a strange land
speaks to the poet
'Are we not of the same soil my lover '
I am able to love my God
because He gives me freedom to deny Him
My untuned strings beg for music
in their anguished cry of shame
The worm thinks it strange and foolish
that man does not eat his books
The clouded sky to-day bears the visior
of the shadow of a divine sadness
on the forehead of brooding eternity
The shade of my tree is for passers-by
its fruit for the one for whom I wait
Flushed with the glow of sunset
earth seems like a ripe fruit
ready to be harvested by night
Light accepts darkness for his spouse
for the sake of creation
The reed waits for his master's breath
the Master goes seeking for his reed
To the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal
its writing unmeaning
The sea smites his own barren breast
because he has no flowers to offer to the moon
The greed for fruit misses the flower
God in His temple of stars
waits for man to bring him his lamp
The fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers
Released from bonds the shameless flame
dies in barren ashes
The sky sets no snare to capture the moon
it is her own freedom which binds her
The light that fills the sky
seeks its limit in a dew-drop on the grass
Wealth is the burden of bigness
Welfare the fulness of being
The razor-blade is proud of its keenness
when it sneers at the sun
The butterfly has leisure to love the lotus
not the bee busily storing honey
Child thou bringest to my heart
the babble of the wind and the water
the flower's speechless secrets the clouds' dreams
the mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky
The rainbow among the clouds may be great
but the little butterfly among the bushes is greater
The mist weaves her net round the morning
captivates him and makes him blind
The Morning Star whispers to Dawn
'Tell me that you are only for me.'
'Yes,' she answers
'And also only for that nameless flower.'
The sky remains infinitely vacant
for earth there to build its heaven with dreams
Perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt
at being told that it is a fragment
awaiting perfection
Let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day
and thus win peace for herself
Beauty smiles in the confinement of the bud
in the heart of a sweet incompleteness
Your flitting love lightly brushed with its wings
my sun-flower
and never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey
Leaves are silences
around flowers which are their words
The tree bears its thousand years
as one large majestic moment
My offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road
but for the wayside shrines
that surprise me at every bend
Hour smile my love like the smell of a strange flower
is simple and inexplicable
Death laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated
for it swells his store with more than he can claim
The sigh of the shore follows in vain
the breeze that hastens the ship across the sea
Truth loves its limits
for there it meets the beautiful
Between the shores of Me and Thee
there is the loud ocean my own surging self
which I long to cross
The right to possess boasts foolishly
of its right to enjoy
The rose is a great deal more
than a blushing apology for the thorn
Day offers to the silence of stars
his golden lute to be tuned
for the endless life
The wise know how to teach
the fool how to smite
The centre is still and silent in the heart
of an eternal dance of circles
The judge thinks that he is just when he compares
The oil of another's lamp
with the light of his own
The captive flower in the King's wreath
smiles bitterly when the meadow-flower envies her
Its store of snow is the hill's own burden
its outpouring of streams is borne by all the world
Listen to the prayer of the forest
for its freedom in flowers
Let your love see me
even through the barrier of nearness
The spirit of work in creation is there
to carry and help the spirit of play
To carry the burden of the instrument
count the cost of its material
and never to know that it is for music
is the tragedy of deaf life
Faith is the bird that feels the light
and sings when the dawn is still dark
I bring to thee night my day's empty cup
to be cleansed with thy cool darkness
for a new morning's festival
The mountain fir in its rustling
modulates the memory of its fights with the storm
into a hymn of peace
God honoured me with his fight
when I was rebellious
He ignored me when I was languid
The sectarian thinks
that he has the sea
ladled into his private pond
In the shady depth of life
are the lonely nests of memories
that shrink from words
Let my love find its strength
in the service of day
its peace in the union of night
Life sends up in blades of grass
its silent hymn of praise
to the unnamed Light
The stars of night are to me
the memorials of my day's faded flowers
Open thy door to that which must go
for the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed
True end is not in the reaching of the limit
but in a completion which is limitless
The shore whispers to the sea
'Write to me what thy waves struggle to say.'
The sea writes in foam again and again
and wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair
Let the touch of thy finger thrill my life's strings
and make the music thine and mine
The inner world rounded in my life like a fruit
matured in joy and sorrow
will drop into the darkness of the original soil
for some further course of creation
Form is in Matter rhythm in Force
meaning in the Person
There are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth
I seek thy company so that I may sing
As the tree its leaves I shed my words on the earth
let my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence
My faith in truth my vision of the perfect
help thee Master in thy creation
All the delights that I have felt
in life's fruits and flowers
let me offer to thee at the end of the feast
in a perfect union of love
Some have thought deeply and explored the
meaning of thy truth
and they are great
I have listened to catch the music of thy play
and I am glad
The tree is a winged spirit
released from the bondage of seed
pursuing its adventure of life
across the unknown
The lotus offers its beauty to the heaven
the grass its service to the earth
The sun's kiss mellows into abandonment
the miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem
The flame met the earthen lamp in me
and what a great marvel of light
Mistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth
and therefore delude us
The cloud laughed at the rainbow
saying that it was an upstart
gaudy in its emptiness
The rainbow calmly answered
'I am as inevitably real as the sun himself.'
Let me not grope in vain in the dark
but keep my mind still in the faith
that the day will break
and truth will appear
in its simplicity
Through the silent night
I hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning
knock at my heart
My new love comes
bringing to me the eternal wealth of the old
The earth gazes at the moon and wonders
that she should have all her music in her smile
Day with its glare of curiosity
puts the stars to flight
My mind has its true union with thee O sky
at the window which is mine own
and not in the open
where thou hast thy sole kingdom
Man claims God's flowers as his own
when he weaves them in a garland
The buried city laid bare to the sun of a new age
is ashamed that is has lost all its song
Like my heart's pain that has long missed its meaning
the sun's rays robed in dark
hide themselves under the ground
Like my heart's pain at love's sudden touch
they change their veil at the spring's call
and come out in the carnival of colours
in flowers and leaves
My life's empty flute
waits for its final music
like the primal darkness
before the stars came out
Emancipation from the bondage of the soil
is no freedom for the tree
The tapestry of life's story is woven
with the threads of life's ties
ever joining and breaking
Those thoughts of mine that are never captured by words
perch upon my song and dance
My soul to-night loses itself
in the silent heart of a tree
standing alone among the whispers of immensity
Pearl shells cast up by the sea
on death's barren beach,
a magnificent wastefulness of creative life
The sunlight opens for me the word's gate
love's light its treasure
My life like the reed with its stops
has its play of colours
through the gaps in its hopes and gains
Let not my thanks to thee
rob my silence of its fuller homage
Life's aspirations come
in the guise of children
The faded flower sighs
that the spring has vanished forever
In my life's garden
my wealth has been of the shadows and lights
that are never gathered and stored
The fruit that I Have gained forever
is that which thou hast accepted
The jasmine knows the sun to be her brother
in the heaven
Light is young the ancient light
shadows are of the moment they are born old
I feel that the ferry of my songs at the day's end
will bring me across to the other shore
from where I shall see
The butterfly flitting from flower to flower
ever remains mine
I lose the one that is netted by me
Your voice free bird reaches my sleeping nest
and my drowsy wings dream
of a voyage to the light
above the clouds
I miss the meaning of my own part
in the play of life
because I know not of the parts
that others play
The flower sheds all its petals
and finds the fruit
I leave my songs behind me
to the bloom of the ever-returning honeysuckles
and the joy of the wind from the south
Dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil
take part in the life of the forest
The mind ever seeks its words
from its sounds and silence
as the sky from its darkness and light
The unseen dark plays on his flute
and the rhythm of light
eddies into stars and suns
into thoughts and dreams
My songs are to sing
that I have loved Thy singing
When the voice of the Silent touches my words
I know him and therefore I know myself
My last salutations are to them
who knew me imperfect and loved me
Love's gift cannot be given
it waits to be accepted
When death comes and whispers to me
'Thy days are ended,'
let me say to him 'I have lived in love
and not in mere time.'
He will ask 'Will thy songs remain '
I shall say 'I know not but this I know
that often when I sang I found my eternity.'
'Let me light my lamp,'
say the star
'and never debate
if it will help to remove the darkness.'
Before the end of my journey
may I reach within myself
the one which is the all
leaving the outer shell
to float away with the drifting multitude
upon the current of chance and change
