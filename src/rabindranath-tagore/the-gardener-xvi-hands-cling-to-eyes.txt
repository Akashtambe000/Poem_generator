Hands cling to hands and eyes linger
on eyes thus begins the record of our
hearts
It is the moonlit night of March
the sweet smell of henna is in the air
my flute lies on the earth neglected
and your garland of flowers is
unfinished
This love between you and me is
simple as a song
Your veil of the saffron colour
makes my eyes drunk
The jasmine wreath that you wove
me thrills to my heart like praise
It is a game of giving and with
holding revealing and screening again
some smiles and some little shyness
and some sweet useless struggles
This love between you and me is
simple as a song
No mystery beyond the present
no striving for the impossible no
shadow behind the charm no groping
in the depth of the dark
This love between you and me is
simple as a song
We do not stray out of all words
into the ever silent we do not raise
our hands to the void for things
beyond hope
It is enough what we give and we
get
We have not crushed the joy to
the utmost to wring from it the wine
of pain
This love between you and me is
simple as a song
