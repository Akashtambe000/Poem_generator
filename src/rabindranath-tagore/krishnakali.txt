In the village they call her the dark girl
but to me she is the flower Krishnakali
On a cloudy day in a field
I saw the dark girl's dark gazelle-eyes
She had no covering on her head
her loose hair had fallen on her back
Dark However dark she be
I have seen her dark gazelleeyes
Two black cows were lowing
as it grew dark under the heavy clouds
So with anxious hurried steps
the dark girl came from her hut
Raising her eyebrows toward the sky
she listened a moment to the clouds' rumble
Dark However dark she be
I have seen her dark gazelle-eyes
A gust of the east wind
rippled the rice plants
I was standing by a ridge
alone in the field
Whether or not she looked at me
Is known only to us two
Dark However dark she be
I have seen her dark gazelle-eyes
This how the Kohldark cloud
rises in the northeast in Jaistha
the soft dark shadow
descends on the Tamal grove in Asharh
and sudden delight floods the heart
in the night of Sravan
Dark However dark she be
I have seen her dark gazelle-eyes
To me she is the flower Krishnakali
whatever she may be called by others
In a field in Maynapara village
I saw the dark girl's dark gazelle-eyes
She did not cover her head
not having the time to feel embarrassed
Dark However dark she be
I have seen her dark gazelle-eyes
