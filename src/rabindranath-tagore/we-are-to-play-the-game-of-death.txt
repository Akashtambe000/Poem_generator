WE are to play the game of death to-night my bride and I
The night is black the clouds in the sky are capricious and the waves are raving at sea
We have left our bed of dreams flung open the door and come out my bride and I
We sit upon a swing and the storm winds give us a wild push from behind
My bride starts up with fear and delight she trembles and clings to my breast
Long have I served her tenderly
I made for her a bed of flowers and I closed the doors to shut out the rude light from her eyes
I kissed her gently on her lips and whispered softly in her ears till she half swooned in languor
She was lost in the endless mist of vague sweetness
She answered not to my touch my songs failed to arouse her
To-night has come to us the call of the storm from the wild
My bride has shivered and stood up she has clasped my hand and come out
Her hair is flying in the wind her veil is fluttering her garland rustles over her breast
The push of death has swung her into life
We are face to face and heart to heart my bride and I
