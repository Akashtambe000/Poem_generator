Do not go my love without asking
my leave
I have watched all night and now
my eyes are heavy with sleep
I fear lest I lose you when I'm
sleeping
Do not go my love without asking
my leave
I start up and stretch my hands to
touch you I ask myself "Is it a
dream?"
Could I but entangle your feet with
my heart and hold them fast to my
breast
Do not go my love without asking
my leave
