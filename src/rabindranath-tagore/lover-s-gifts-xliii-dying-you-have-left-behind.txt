Dying you have left behind you the great sadness of the Eternal
in my life You have painted my thought's horizon with the sunset
colours of your departure leaving a track of tears across the
earth to love's heaven Clasped in your dear arms life and death
united in me in a marriage bond
I think I can see you watching there in the balcony with your
lamp lighted where the end and the beginning of all things meet
My world went hence through the doors that you opened-you holding
the cup of death to my lips filling it with life from your own
