The fair was on before the temple
It had rained from the early morning
and the day came to its end
Brighter than all the gladness of
the crowd was the bright smile of
a girl who bought for a farthing a
whistle of palm leaf
The shrill joy of that whistle floated
above all laughter and noise
An endless throng of people came
and jostled together The road was
muddy the river in flood the field
under water in ceaseless rain
Greater than all the troubles of
the crowd was a little boy's trouble
he had not a farthing to buy a painted
stick
His wistful eyes gazing at the shop
made this whole meeting of men so
pitiful
