Do not keep to yourself the secret of
your heart my friend
Say it to me only to me in secret
You who smile so gently softly
whisper my heart will hear it not my
ears
The night is deep the house is
silent the birds' nests are shrouded
with sleep
Speak to me through hesitating
tears through faltering smiles through
sweet shame and pain the secret of
your heart
