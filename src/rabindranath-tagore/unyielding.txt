When I called you in your garden
Mango blooms were rich in fragrance 
Why did you remain so distant
Keep your doors so tightly fastened
Blossoms grew to ripe fruit-clusters 
Your rejected my cuppded handfuls
Closed your eyes to perfectness
In the fierce harsh storms of Baisakh
Golden ripened fruit fell tumbling
'Dust I said 'defiles such offerings
Let your hands be heaven to them.'
Still you showed no friendliness
Lampless were your doors at evening
Pitch-black as I played my vina
How the starlight twanged my heartstrings
How I set my vina dancing
You showed no responsiveness
Sad birds twittered sleeplessly
Calling calling lost companions
Gone the right time for our union 
Low the moon while still you brooded
Sunk in lonely pensiveness
Who can understand another
Heart cannot restrain its passion
I had hoped that some remaining
Tear-soaked memories would sway you
Stir your feet to lightsomeness
Moon fell at the feet of morning
Loosened from the night's fading necklace
While you slept O did my Vina
Lull you with its heartache Did you
Dream at least of happiness
