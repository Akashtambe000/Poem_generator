I ask for a moments indulgence to sit by thy side The works
that I have in hand I will finish afterwards
Away from the sight of thy face my heart knows no rest nor respite
and my work becomes an endless toil in a shoreless sea of toil
Today the summer has come at my window with its sighs and murmurs and
the bees are plying their minstrelsy at the court of the flowering grove
Now it is time to sit quite face to face with thee and to sing
dedication of life in this silent and overflowing leisure
Pity in place of love
That pettiest of gifts
Is but a sugarcoating over neglect
Any passerby can make a gift of it
To a street beggar
Only to forget the moment the first corner is turned
I had not hoped for anything more that day
You left during the last watch of night
I had hoped you would say goodbye
Just say Adieu before going away
What you had said another day
What I shall never hear again
In their place just that one word
Bound by the thin fabric of a little compassion
Would even that have been too much for you to bear
When I first awoke from sleep
My heart fluttered with fear
Lest the time had been over
I rushed out of bed
The distant church clock chimed half past twelve
I sat waiting near the door of my room
Resting my head against it
Facing the porch through which you would come out
Even that tiniest of chances
Was snatched away by fate from hapless me
I fell asleep
Shortly before you left
Perhaps you cast a sidelong glance
At my reclining body
Like a broken boat left high and dry
Perhaps you walked away with care
Lest you wake me up
Awaking with a start I knew at once
That my vigil had been wasted
I realised what was to go went away in a moment
What was to stay behind stayed on
For all time
Silence everywhere
Like that of a birds nest bereft of birds
On the bough of a songless tree
With the lifeless light of the waning moon was now blended
The pallor of dawn
Spreading itself over the greyness of my empty life
I walked towards your bedroom
For no reason
Outside the door
Burnt a smoky lantern covered with soot
The porch smelt of the smouldering wick
Over the abandoned bed the flaps of the rolledup mosquitonet
Fluttered a little in the breeze
Seen in the sky outside through the window
Was the morning star
Witness of all sleepless people
Bereft of hope
Suddenly I found you had left behind by mistake
Your goldmounted ivory walking stick
If there were time I thought
You might come back from the station to look for it
But not because
You had not seen me before going away
You say that father write a lot of books but what he write I dont
understand
He was reading to you all the evening but could you really
make out what he meant
What nice stores mother you can tell us Why cant father
write like that I wonder
Did he never hear from his own mother stories of giants and
fairies and princesses
Has he forgotten them all
Often when he gets late for his bath you have to and call him
an hundred times
You wait and keep his dishes warm for him but he goes on
writing and forgets
Father always plays at making books
If ever I go to play in fathers room you come and call me
What a naughty child
If I make the slightest noise you say Dont you see that
fathers at his work
Whats the fun of always writing and writing
When I take up fathers pen or pencil and write upon his book
just as he doesabcdefghiwhy do you get cross with me
then mother
You never say a word when father writes
When my father wastes such heaps of paper mother you dont
seem to mind at all
But if I take only one sheet to take a boat with you say
Child how troublesome you are
What do you think of fathers spoiling sheets and sheets of
paper with black marks all over both sides
If baby only wanted to he could fly up to heaven this moment
It is not for nothing that he does not leave us
He loves to rest his head on mothers bosom and cannot ever
bear to lose sight of her
Baby know all manner of wise words though few on earth can
understand their meaning
It is not for nothing that he never wants to speak
The one thing he wants is to learn mothers words from
mothers lips That is why he looks so innocent
Baby had a heap of gold and pearls yet he came like a beggar
on to this earth
It is not for nothing he came in such a disguise
This dear little naked mendicant pretends to be utterly
helpless so that he may beg for mothers wealth of love
Baby was so free from every tie in the land of the tiny
crescent moon
It was not for nothing he gave up his freedom
He knows that there is room for endless joy in mothers little
corner of a heart and it is sweeter far than liberty to be caught
and pressed in her dear arms
Baby never knew how to cry He dwelt in the land of perfect
bliss
It is not for nothing he has chosen to shed tears
Though with the smile of his dear face he draws mothers
yearning heart to him yet his little cries over tiny troubles
weave the double bond of pity and love
I wish I could take a quiet corner in the heart of my babys very
own world
I know it has stars that talk to him and a sky that stoops
down to his face to amuse him with its silly clouds and rainbows
Those who make believe to be dumb and look as if they never
could move come creeping to his window with their stories and with
trays crowded with bright toys
I wish I could travel by the road that crosses babys mind
and out beyond all bounds
Where messengers run errands for no cause between the kingdoms
of kings of no history
Where Reason makes kites of her laws and flies them the Truth
sets Fact free from its fetters
When the heart is hard and parched up
come upon me with a shower of mercy
When grace is lost from life
come with a burst of song
When tumultuous work raises its din on all sides shutting me out from
beyond come to me my lord of silence with thy peace and rest
When my beggarly heart sits crouched shut up in a corner
break open the door my king and come with the ceremony of a king
When desire blinds the mind with delusion and dust O thou holy one
thou wakeful come with thy light and thy thunder

Bless this little heart this white soul that has won the kiss of
heaven for our earth
He loves the light of the sun he loves the sight of his
mothers face
He has not learned to despise the dust and to hanker after
gold
Clasp him to your heart and bless him
He has come into this land of an hundred crossroads
I know not how he chose you from the crowd came to your door
and grasped you hand to ask his way
He will follow you laughing the talking and not a doubt in
his heart
Keep his trust lead him straight and bless him
Lay your hand on his head and pray that though the waves
underneath grow threatening yet the breath from above may come and
fill his sails and waft him to the heaven of peace
Forget him not in your hurry let him come to your heart and
bless him
I THE DARK
In a worldless timeless lightless great emptiness
Fourfaced Brahma broods
nasad asin no sad asit tadanim
nasid raja no vioma paro yat
kim avarivah kuha kasya sarmann
Ambhah kim asid gahanam gabhiram
na mytur asid amrtam na tarhi
na ratria ahna asit pratekh
anid avatam svadhaya tad ekam
tasmad dhanyan na parah kim canasa
tama asit tamasa gudham agre
apraketam salilam sarvam a idam
tuchyenabhu apihitam yad asit
tapasas tan mahinajayataikam
Of a sudden sea of joy surges through his heart –
The urgod opens his eyes
Speech from four mouths
Speeds from each quarter
Through infinite dark
Through limitless sky
Like a growing seastorm
Like hope never sated
His Word starts to move
Stirred by joy his breathing quickens
His eight eyes quiver with flame
His firematted hair sweeps the horizon
Bright as a million suns
From the towering source of the world
In a thousand streams
Cascades the primeval blazing fountain
Fragmenting silence
Splitting its stone heart
kamas tad agre sam avartatadhi
manaso retah prathamam yad asit
sato bandhum asati nir avindan
hrdi pratisya kavayo manisa
II THE MUSIC
In a universe rampant
With new life exhalant
With new life exultant
Vishnu spreads wide
His fourhanded blessing
He raises his conch
And all things quake
At its booming sound
The frenzy dies down
The furnace expires
The planets douse
Their flames with tears
The world’s Divine Poet
Constructs its history
From wild cosmic song
Its epic is formed
Stars in their orbits
Moon sun and planets –
He binds with his mace
All things to Law
Imposes the discipline
Of metre and rhyme
In the Manasa depths
Vishnu watches
Beauties arise
From the light of lotuses
Lakshmi strews smiles
Clouds show a rainbow
Gardens show flowers
The roar of Creation
Resolves into music
Softness hides rigour
Forms cover power
tirascino vitato rasmir esam
adhah svid asid upari svid asit
retodha asan mahimana asan
svadha avasat prayatih parastat
Age after age after age is slave to a mighty rhythm –
At last the worldframe
Tires in its body
Sleep in its eyes
Slackens its structure
Diffuses its energy
From the heart of all matter
Comes the anguished cry –
‘Wake wake great Shiva
Our body grows weary
Of its lawfixed path
Give us new form
Sing our destruction
That we gain new life’
III THE FIRE
The great god awakes
His three eyes open
He surveys all horizons
He lifts his bow his fell pinaka
He pounds the world with his tread
From first things to last it trembles and shakes
And shudders
The bonds of nature are ripped
The sky is rocked by the roar
Of a wave of ecstatic release
An inferno soars –
The pyre of the universe
Shattered sun and moon smashed stars and planets
Rain down from all angles
A blackness of all particles
To be swallowed by flame
Absorbed in an instant
At the start of Creation
There was a dark without origin
At the breaking of Creation
There is fire without end
In an allpervading skyengulfing sea of burning
Shiva shuts his three eyes
He begins his great trance
ko adha veda Ka iha pravocat
kuta ajata kuta iyam visrstih
arvag deva asya visajanena
atha ko veda yata ababhuva
iyam visrstir yata ababhuva
yadi vasa dadhe yadi van na
yo asyadhyaksah parame vioman
so anga veda yadi va na veda
In desperate hope I go and search for her
in all the corners of my room
I find her not
My house is small
and what once has gone from it can never be regained
But infinite is thy mansion my lord
and seeking her I have to come to thy door
I stand under the golden canopy of thine evening sky
and I lift my eager eyes to thy face
I have come to the brink of eternity from which nothing can vanish
no hope no happiness no vision of a face seen through tears
Oh dip my emptied life into that ocean
plunge it into the deepest fullness
Let me for once feel that lost sweet touch
in the allness of the universe

Kasinath the new young singer fills the hall with sound
The seven notes dance in his throat like seven tame birds
His voice is a sharp sword slicing and thrusting everywhere
It darts like lightening no knowing where it will go when
He sets deadly traps for himself then cuts them away
The courtiers listen in amazement give frequent gasps of praise
Only the old king Pratap Ray sits like wood unmoved
Haraj Lal is the only singer he likes all others leave him cold
From childhood he has spent so long listening to him sing
Rag Kafi during holi cloudsongs during the rains
Songs for Durga at dawn in autumn songs to bid her farewell
His heart swelled when he heard them and his eyes swam with tears
And on days when friends gathered and filled the hall
There were cowherds songs of Krsna in raags Bhupali and Multan
So many nights of weddingfestivity have passed in that royal house
Servants dressed in red hundreds of lamps alight
The bridegroom sitting shyly in his finery and jewels
Young friends teasing him and whispering in his ear
Before him singing raag Sahana sits Baraj Lal
The kings heart is full of all those days and songs
When he hears some other singer he feels no chord inside
No sudden magical awakening of memories of the past
When Pratap Ray watches Kasinath he just sees his wagging head
Tune after tune after tune bu none with any echo in the heart
Kasinath asks for a rest and the singing stops for a space
Pratap Ray smilingly turns his eyes to Baraj Lal
He puts his mouth to his ear and says Dear ustad
Give us a song as songs ought to be this is no song at all
Its all tricks and games like a cat hunting a bird
We used to hear songs in the old days today they have no idea
Old Baraj Lal whitehaired white turban on his head
Bows to the assembled courtiers and slowly takes his seat
He takes the tanpura in his wasted heavily veined hand
And with lowered head and closed eyes begins raag Yamankalyap
His quavering voice is swallowed by the enormous hall
Is like a tiny bird in a storm unable to fly for all it tries
Pratap Ray sitting to the left encourages him again and again
Superb bravo he says in his ear sing out loud
The courtiers are inattentive some whisper amongst themselves
Some of them yawn some doze some go off to their rooms
Some of them call to servants Bring the bookah bring some pan
Some fan themselves furiously and complain of the heat
They cannot keep still for a minute they shuffle or walk about
The hall was quiet before but every sort of noise has grown
The old mans singing is swamped like a frail boat in a typhoon
Only his shaky fingering of the tanpura shows it is there
Music that should rise on its own joy from the depths of the heart
Is crushed by heedless clamour like a fountain under a stone
The song and Baraj Lals feelings go separate ways
But he sings for all he is worth to keep up the honour of his king
One of the verses of the song has somehow slipped from his mind
He quickly goes back tries to get it right this time
Again he forgets it is lost he shakes his head at the shame
He starts the song at the beginning again he has to stop
His hand trembles doubly as he prays to his teachers name
His voice quakes with distress like a lamp guttering in a breeze
He abandons the words of the song and tries to salvage the tune
But suddenly his widemouthed singing breaks into loud cries
The intricate melody goes to the winds the rhythm is swept away
Tears snap the thread of the song cascade like pearls
In shame he rests his head on the old tanpura in his lap
He has failed to remember a song he weeps as he did as a child
With brimming eyes king Pratap Ray tenderly touches his friend
Come let us go from here he says with kindness and love
They leave that festive hall with its hundreds of blinding lights
The two old friends go outside holding each others hands
Baraj says with hands clasped Master our days are gone
New men have come now new styles and customs in the world
The court we kept is deserted only the two of us are left
Dont ask anyone to listen to me now I beg you at your feet my lord
The singer along does not make a song there has to be someone who hears
One man opens his throat to sing the other sings in his mind
Only when waves fall on the shore do they make a harmonious sound
Only when breezes shake the woods do we hear a rustling in the leaves
Only from a marriage of two forces does music arise in the world
Where there is no love where listeners are dumb there never can be song
Mother I shall weave a chain of pearls for thy neck
with my tears of sorrow
The stars have wrought their anklets of light to deck thy feet
but mine will hang upon thy breast
Wealth and fame come from thee
and it is for thee to give or to withhold them
But this my sorrow is absolutely mine own
and when I bring it to thee as my offering
thou rewardest me with thy grace
I thought that my voyage had come to its end
at the last limit of my powerthat the path before me was closed
that provisions were exhausted
and the time come to take shelter in a silent obscurity
But I find that thy will knows no end in me
And when old words die out on the tongue
new melodies break forth from the heart
and where the old tracks are lost
new country is revealed with its wonders
Mother the folk who live up in the clouds call out to me
We play from the time we wake till the day ends
We play with the golden dawn we play with the silver moon
I ask But how am I to get up to you 
They answer Come to the edge of the earth lift up your
hands to the sky and you will be taken up into the clouds
My mother is waiting for me at home I say How can I leave
her and come
Then they smile and float away
But I know a nicer game than that mother
I shall be the cloud and you the moon
I shall cover you with both my hands and our housetop will
be the blue sky
The folk who live in the waves call out to me
We sing from morning till night on and on we travel and know
not where we pass
I ask But how am I to join you
They tell me Come to the edge of the shore and stand with
your eyes tight shut and you will be carried out upon the waves
I say My mother always wants me at home in the everything
how can I leave her and go
They smile dance and pass by
But I know a better game than that
I will be the waves and you will be a strange shore
I shall roll on and on and on and break upon your lap with
laughter
And no one in the world will know where we both are
When I bring to you colored toys my child
I understand why there is such a play of colors on clouds on water
and why flowers are painted in tints
when I give colored toys to you my child
When I sing to make you dance
I truly now why there is music in leaves
and why waves send their chorus of voices to the heart of the listening earth
when I sing to make you dance
When I bring sweet things to your greedy hands
I know why there is honey in the cup of the flowers
and why fruits are secretly filled with sweet juice
when I bring sweet things to your greedy hands
When I kiss your face to make you smile my darling
I surely understand what pleasure streams from the sky in morning light
and what delight that is that is which the summer breeze brings to my body
when I kiss you to make you smile

O thou the last fulfilment of life
Death my death come and whisper to me
Day after day I have kept watch for thee
for thee have I borne the joys and pangs of life
All that I am that I have that I hope and all my love
have ever flowed towards thee in depth of secrecy
One final glance from thine eyes
and my life will be ever thine own
The flowers have been woven
and the garland is ready for the bridegroom
After the wedding the bride shall leave her home
and meet her lord alone in the solitude of night
Whey are those tears in your eyes my child
How horrid of them to be always scolding you for nothing
You have stained your fingers and face with ink while writing
is that why they call you dirty
O fie Would they dare to call the full moon dirty because
it has smudged its face with ink
For every little trifle they blame you my child They are
ready to find fault for nothing
You tore your clothes while playingis that why they call you
untidy
O fie What would they call an autumn morning that smiles
through its ragged clouds
Take no heed of what they say to you my child
They make a long list of your misdeeds
Everybody knows how you love sweet thingsis that why they
call you greedy
O fie What then would they call us who love you
I know not from what distant time
thou art ever coming nearer to meet me
Thy sun and stars can never keep thee hidden from me for aye
In many a morning and eve thy footsteps have been heard
and thy messenger has come within my heart and called me in secret
I know not only why today my life is all astir
and a feeling of tremulous joy is passing through my heart
It is as if the time were come to wind up my work
and I feel in the air a faint smell of thy sweet presence
He whom I enclose with my name is weeping in this dungeon
I am ever busy building this wall all around and as this wall goes up into
the sky day by day I lose sight of my true being in its dark shadow
I take pride in this great wall and I plaster it with dust and sand
lest a least hole should be left in this name
and for all the care I take I lose sight of my true being
Time is endless in thy hands my lord
There is none to count thy minutes
Days and nights pass and ages bloom and fade like flowers
Thou knowest how to wait
Thy centuries follow each other perfecting a small wild flower
We have no time to lose
and having no time we must scramble for a chance
We are too poor to be late
And thus it is that time goes by
while I give it to every querulous man who claims it
and thine altar is empty of all offerings to the last
At the end of the day I hasten in fear lest thy gate be shut
but I find that yet there is time

Day after day O lord of my life
shall I stand before thee face to face
With folded hands O lord of all worlds
shall I stand before thee face to face
Under thy great sky in solitude and silence
with humble heart shall I stand before thee face to face
In this laborious world of thine tumultuous with toil
and with struggle among hurrying crowds
shall I stand before thee face to face
And when my work shall be done in this world
O King of kings alone and speechless
shall I stand before thee face to face

If people came to know where my kings palace is it would vanish
into the air
The walls are of white silver and the roof of shining gold
The queen lives in a palace with seven courtyards and she
wears a jewel that cost all the wealth of seven kingdoms
But let me tell you mother in a whisper where my kings
palace is
It is at the corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi
plant stands
The princess lies sleeping on the faraway shore of the seven
impassable seas
There is none in the world who can find her but myself
She has bracelets on her arms and pearl drops in her ears her
hair sweeps down upon the floor
She will wake when I touch her with my magic wand and jewels
will fall from her lips when she smiles
But let me whisper in your ear mother she is there in the
corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi plant stands
When it is time for you to go to the river for your bath step
up to that terrace on the roof
I sit in the corner where the shadow of the walls meet
together
Only puss is allowed to come with me for she know where the
barber in the story lives
But let me whisper mother in your ear where the barber in
the story lives
It is at the corner of the terrace where the pot of the tulsi
plant stands
I have got my leave Bid me farewell my brothers
I bow to you all and take my departure
Here I give back the keys of my door
and I give up all claims to my house
I only ask for last kind words from you
We were neighbors for long
but I received more than I could give
Now the day has dawned
and the lamp that lit my dark corner is out
A summons has come and I am ready for my journey

My fancies are fireflies
Specks of living light
twinkling in the dark
The voice of wayside pansies
that do not attract the careless glance
murmurs in these desultory lines
In the drowsy dark caves of the mind
dreams build their nest with fragments
dropped from days caravan
Spring scatters the petals of flowers
that are not for the fruits of the future
but for the moments whim
Joy freed from the bond of earths slumber
rushes into numberless leaves
and dances in the air for a day
My words that are slight
may lightly dance upon times waves
when my works heavy with import have gone down
Minds underground moths
grow filmy wings
and take a farewell flight
in the sunset sky
The butterfly counts not months but moments
and has time enough
My thoughts like spark ride on winged surprises
carrying a single laughter
The tree gazes in love at its own beautiful shadow
which yet it never can grasp
Let my love like sunlight surround you
and yet give you illumined freedom
Days are coloured bubbles
that float upon the surface of fathomless night
My offerings are too timid to claim your remembrance
and therefore you may remember them
Leave out my name from the gift
if it be a burden
but keep my song
April like a child
writes hieroglyphs on dust with flowers
wipes them away and forgets
Memory the priestess
kills the present
and offers its heart to the shrine of the dead past
From the solemn gloom of the temple
children run out to sit in the dust
God watches them play
and forgets the priest
My mind starts up at some flash
on the flow of its thoughts
like a brook at a sudden liquid note of its own
that is never repeated
In the mountain stillness surges up
to explore its own height
in the lake movement stands still
to contemplate its own depth
The departing nights one kiss
on the closed eyes of morning
glows in the star of dawn
Maiden thy beauty is like a fruit
which is yet to mature
tense with an unyielding secret
Sorrow that has lost its memory
is like the dumb dark hours
that have no bird songs
but only the crickets chirp
Bigotry tries to keep truth safe in its hand
with a grip that kills it
Wishing to hearten a timid lamp
great night lights all her stars
Though he holds in his arms the earthbride
the sky is ever immensely away
God seeks comrades and claims love
the Devil seeks slaves and claims obedience
The soil in return for her service
keeps the tree tied to her
the sky asks nothing and leaves it free
Jewellike immortal
does not boast of its length of years
but of the scintillating point of its moment
The child ever dwells in the mystery of ageless time
unobscured by the dust of history
Alight laughter in the steps of creation
carries it swiftly across time
One who was distant came near to me in the morning
and still nearer when taken away by night
White and pink oleanders meet
and make merry in different dialects
When peace is active sweeping its dirt it is storm
The lake lies low by the hill
a tearful entreaty of love
at the foot of the inflexible
There smiles the Divine Child
among his playthings of unmeaning clouds
and ephemeral lights and shadows
The breeze whispers to the lotus
What is thy secret 
It is myself says the lotus
Steal it and I disappear 
The freedom of the storm and the bondage of the stem
join hands in the dance of swaying branches
The jasmines lisping of love to the sun is her flowers
The tyrant claims freedom to kill freedom
and yet to keep it for himself
Gods tired of their paradise envy man
Clouds are hills in vapour
hills are clouds in stone
a phantasy in times dream
While God waits for His temple to be built of love
men bring stones
I touch God in my song
as the hill touches the faraway sea
with its waterfall
Light finds her treasure of colours
through the antagonism of clouds
My heart today smiles at its past night of tears
like a wet tree glistening in the sun
after the rain is over
I have thanked the trees that have made my life fruitful
but have failed to remember the grass
that has ever kept it green
The one without second is emptiness
the other one makes it true
Lifes errors cry for the merciful beauty
that can modulate their isolation
into a harmony with the whole
They expect thanks for the banished nest
because their cage is shapely and secure
In love I pay my endless debt to thee
for what thou art
The pond sends up its lyrics from its dark in lilies
and the sun says they are good
Your calumny against the great is impious
it hurts yourself
against the small it is mean
for it hurts the victim
The first flower that blossomed on this earth
was an invitation to the unborn song
Dawnthe manycoloured flowerfades
and then the simple lightfruit
the sun appears
The muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom
throttles the voice that would cry
The wind tries to take the flame by storm
only to blow it out
Lifes play is swift
Lifes playthings fall behind one by one
and are forgotten
My flower seek not thy paradise
in a fools buttonhole
Thou hast risen late my crescent moon
but my night bird is still awake to greet thee
Darkness is the veiled bride
silently waiting for the errant light
to return to her bosom
Trees are the earths endless effort to
speak to the listening heaven
The burden of self is lightened
when I laugh at myself
The weak can be terrible
because they try furiously to appear strong
The wind of heaven blows
The anchor desperately clutches the mud
and my boat is beating its breast against the chain
The spirit of death is one
the spirit of life is many
When God is dead religion becomes one
The blue of the sky longs for the earths green
the wind between them sighs Alas
Days pain muffled by its own glare
burns among stars in the night
The stars crowd round the virgin night
in silent awe at her loneliness
that can never be touched
The cloud gives all its gold
to the departing sun
and greets the rising moon
with only a pale smile
He who does good comes to the temple gate
he who loves reaches the shrine
Flower have pity for the worm
it is not a bee
its love is a blunder and a burden
With the ruins of terrors triumph
children build their dolls house
The lamp waits through the long day of neglect
for the flames kiss in the night
Feathers in the dust lying lazily content
have forgotten their sky
The flowers which is single
need not envy the thorns
that are numerous
The world suffers most from the disinterested tyranny
of its wellwisher
We gain freedom when we have paid the full price
for our right to live
Your careless gifts of a moment
like the meteors of an autumn night
catch fire in the depth of my being
The faith waiting in the heart of a seed
promises a miracle of life
which it cannot prove at once
Spring hesitates at winters door
but the mango blossom rashly runs out to him
before her time and meets her doom
The world is the everchanging foam
that floats on the surface of a sea of silence
The two separated shores mingle their voices
in a song of unfathomed tears
As a river in the sea
work finds its fulfilment
in the depth of leisure
I lingered on my way till thy cherry tree lost its blossom
but the azalea brings to me my love thy forgiveness
Thy shy little pomegranate bud
blushing today behind her veil
will burst into a passionate flower
tomorrow when I am away
The clumsiness of power spoils the key
and uses the pickaxe
Birth is from the mystery of night
into the greater mystery of day
These paper boats of mine are meant to dance
on the ripples of hours
and not to reach any destination
Migratory songs wing from my heart
and seek their nests in your voice of love
The sea of danger doubt and denial
around mans little island of certainty
challenges him to dare the unknown
Love punishes when it forgives
and injured beauty by its awful silence
You live alone and unrecompensed
because they are afraid of your great worth
The same sun is newly born in new lands
in a ring of endless dawns
God is world is ever renewed by death
a Titans ever crushed by its own existence
The glowworm while exploring the dust
never knows that stars are in the sky
The tree is of today the flower is old
it brings with it the message
of the immemorial seed
Each rose that comes brings me greetings
from the Rose of an eternal spring
God honours me when I work
He loves me when I sing
My love of today finds no home
in the nest deserted by yesterdays love
The fire of pain traces for my soul
a luminous path across her sorrow
The grass survives the hill
through its resurrections from countless deaths
Thou hast vanished from my reach
leaving an impalpable touch in the blue of the sky
an invisible image in the wind moving
among the shadows
In pity for the desolate branch
spring leaves to it a kiss that fluttered in a lonely leaf
The shy shadow in the garden
loves the sun in silence
Flowers guess the secret and smile
while the leaves whisper
I leave no trace of wings in the air
but I am glad I have had my flight
The fireflies twinkling among leaves
make the stars wonder
The mountain remains unmoved
at its seeming defeat by the mist
While the rose said to the sun
I shall ever remember thee
her petals fell to the dust
Hills are the earths gesture of despair
for the unreachable
Though the thorn in thy flower pricked me
O Beauty
I am grateful
The world knows that the few
are more than the many
Let not my love be a burden on you my friend
know that it pays itself
Dawn plays her lute before the gate of darkness
and is content to vanish when the sun comes out
Beauty is truths smile
when she beholds her own face
in a perfect mirror
The dewdrop knows the sun
only within its own tiny orb
Forlorn thoughts from the forsaken lives of all ages
swarming in the air hum round my heart
and seek my voice
The desert is imprisoned in the wall
of its unbounded barrenness
In the thrill of little leaves
I see the airs invisible dance
and in their glimmering
the secret heartbeats of the sky
You are like a flowering tree
amazed when I praise you for your gifts
The earths sacrificial fire
flames up in her trees
scattering sparks in flowers
Forests the clouds of earth
hold up to the sky their silence
and clouds from above come down
in resonant showers
The world speaks to me in pictures
my soul answers in music
The sky tells its beads all night
on the countless stars
in memory of the sun
The darkness of night like pain is dumb
the darkness of dawn like peace is silent
Pride engraves his frowns in stones
love offers her surrender in flowers
The obsequious brush curtails truth
in deference to the canvas which is narrow
The hill in its longing for the faraway sky
wishes to be like the cloud
with its endless urge of seeking
To justify their own spilling of ink
they spell the day as night
Profit smiles on goodness
when the good is profitable
In its swelling pride
the bubble doubts the truth of the sea
and laughs and bursts into emptiness
Love is an endless mystery
for it has nothing else to explain it
My clouds sorrowing in the dark
forget that they themselves
have hidden the sun
Man discovers his own wealth
when God comes to ask gifts of him
You leave your memory as a flame
to my lonely lamp of separation
I came to offer thee a flower
but thou must have all my garden
It is thine
The picturea memory of light
treasured by the shadow
It is easy to make faces at the sun
He is exposed by his own light in all
directions
History slowly smothers its truth
but hastily struggles to revive it
in the terrible penance of pain
My work is rewarded in daily wages
I wait for my final value in love
Beauty knows to say Enough
barbarism clamours for still more
God loves to see in me not his servant
but himself who serves all
The darkness of night is in harmony with day
the morning of mist is discordant
In the bounteous time of roses love is wine
it is food in the famished hour
when their petals are shed
An unknown flower in a strange land
speaks to the poet
Are we not of the same soil my lover 
I am able to love my God
because He gives me freedom to deny Him
My untuned strings beg for music
in their anguished cry of shame
The worm thinks it strange and foolish
that man does not eat his books
The clouded sky today bears the visior
of the shadow of a divine sadness
on the forehead of brooding eternity
The shade of my tree is for passersby
its fruit for the one for whom I wait
Flushed with the glow of sunset
earth seems like a ripe fruit
ready to be harvested by night
Light accepts darkness for his spouse
for the sake of creation
The reed waits for his masters breath
the Master goes seeking for his reed
To the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal
its writing unmeaning
The sea smites his own barren breast
because he has no flowers to offer to the moon
The greed for fruit misses the flower
God in His temple of stars
waits for man to bring him his lamp
The fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers
Released from bonds the shameless flame
dies in barren ashes
The sky sets no snare to capture the moon
it is her own freedom which binds her
The light that fills the sky
seeks its limit in a dewdrop on the grass
Wealth is the burden of bigness
Welfare the fulness of being
The razorblade is proud of its keenness
when it sneers at the sun
The butterfly has leisure to love the lotus
not the bee busily storing honey
Child thou bringest to my heart
the babble of the wind and the water
the flowers speechless secrets the clouds dreams
the mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky
The rainbow among the clouds may be great
but the little butterfly among the bushes is greater
The mist weaves her net round the morning
captivates him and makes him blind
The Morning Star whispers to Dawn
Tell me that you are only for me
Yes she answers
And also only for that nameless flower
The sky remains infinitely vacant
for earth there to build its heaven with dreams
Perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt
at being told that it is a fragment
awaiting perfection
Let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day
and thus win peace for herself
Beauty smiles in the confinement of the bud
in the heart of a sweet incompleteness
Your flitting love lightly brushed with its wings
my sunflower
and never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey
Leaves are silences
around flowers which are their words
The tree bears its thousand years
as one large majestic moment
My offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road
but for the wayside shrines
that surprise me at every bend
Hour smile my love like the smell of a strange flower
is simple and inexplicable
Death laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated
for it swells his store with more than he can claim
The sigh of the shore follows in vain
the breeze that hastens the ship across the sea
Truth loves its limits
for there it meets the beautiful
Between the shores of Me and Thee
there is the loud ocean my own surging self
which I long to cross
The right to possess boasts foolishly
of its right to enjoy
The rose is a great deal more
than a blushing apology for the thorn
Day offers to the silence of stars
his golden lute to be tuned
for the endless life
The wise know how to teach
the fool how to smite
The centre is still and silent in the heart
of an eternal dance of circles
The judge thinks that he is just when he compares
The oil of anothers lamp
with the light of his own
The captive flower in the Kings wreath
smiles bitterly when the meadowflower envies her
Its store of snow is the hills own burden
its outpouring of streams is borne by all the world
Listen to the prayer of the forest
for its freedom in flowers
Let your love see me
even through the barrier of nearness
The spirit of work in creation is there
to carry and help the spirit of play
To carry the burden of the instrument
count the cost of its material
and never to know that it is for music
is the tragedy of deaf life
Faith is the bird that feels the light
and sings when the dawn is still dark
I bring to thee night my days empty cup
to be cleansed with thy cool darkness
for a new mornings festival
The mountain fir in its rustling
modulates the memory of its fights with the storm
into a hymn of peace
God honoured me with his fight
when I was rebellious
He ignored me when I was languid
The sectarian thinks
that he has the sea
ladled into his private pond
In the shady depth of life
are the lonely nests of memories
that shrink from words
Let my love find its strength
in the service of day
its peace in the union of night
Life sends up in blades of grass
its silent hymn of praise
to the unnamed Light
The stars of night are to me
the memorials of my days faded flowers
Open thy door to that which must go
for the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed
True end is not in the reaching of the limit
but in a completion which is limitless
The shore whispers to the sea
Write to me what thy waves struggle to say
The sea writes in foam again and again
and wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair
Let the touch of thy finger thrill my lifes strings
and make the music thine and mine
The inner world rounded in my life like a fruit
matured in joy and sorrow
will drop into the darkness of the original soil
for some further course of creation
Form is in Matter rhythm in Force
meaning in the Person
There are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth
I seek thy company so that I may sing
As the tree its leaves I shed my words on the earth
let my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence
My faith in truth my vision of the perfect
help thee Master in thy creation
All the delights that I have felt
in lifes fruits and flowers
let me offer to thee at the end of the feast
in a perfect union of love
Some have thought deeply and explored the
meaning of thy truth
and they are great
I have listened to catch the music of thy play
and I am glad
The tree is a winged spirit
released from the bondage of seed
pursuing its adventure of life
across the unknown
The lotus offers its beauty to the heaven
the grass its service to the earth
The suns kiss mellows into abandonment
the miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem
The flame met the earthen lamp in me
and what a great marvel of light
Mistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth
and therefore delude us
The cloud laughed at the rainbow
saying that it was an upstart
gaudy in its emptiness
The rainbow calmly answered
I am as inevitably real as the sun himself
Let me not grope in vain in the dark
but keep my mind still in the faith
that the day will break
and truth will appear
in its simplicity
Through the silent night
I hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning
knock at my heart
My new love comes
bringing to me the eternal wealth of the old
The earth gazes at the moon and wonders
that she should have all her music in her smile
Day with its glare of curiosity
puts the stars to flight
My mind has its true union with thee O sky
at the window which is mine own
and not in the open
where thou hast thy sole kingdom
Man claims Gods flowers as his own
when he weaves them in a garland
The buried city laid bare to the sun of a new age
is ashamed that is has lost all its song
Like my hearts pain that has long missed its meaning
the suns rays robed in dark
hide themselves under the ground
Like my hearts pain at loves sudden touch
they change their veil at the springs call
and come out in the carnival of colours
in flowers and leaves
My lifes empty flute
waits for its final music
like the primal darkness
before the stars came out
Emancipation from the bondage of the soil
is no freedom for the tree
The tapestry of lifes story is woven
with the threads of lifes ties
ever joining and breaking
Those thoughts of mine that are never captured by words
perch upon my song and dance
My soul tonight loses itself
in the silent heart of a tree
standing alone among the whispers of immensity
Pearl shells cast up by the sea
on deaths barren beach
a magnificent wastefulness of creative life
The sunlight opens for me the words gate
loves light its treasure
My life like the reed with its stops
has its play of colours
through the gaps in its hopes and gains
Let not my thanks to thee
rob my silence of its fuller homage
Lifes aspirations come
in the guise of children
The faded flower sighs
that the spring has vanished forever
In my lifes garden
my wealth has been of the shadows and lights
that are never gathered and stored
The fruit that I Have gained forever
is that which thou hast accepted
The jasmine knows the sun to be her brother
in the heaven
Light is young the ancient light
shadows are of the moment they are born old
I feel that the ferry of my songs at the days end
will bring me across to the other shore
from where I shall see
The butterfly flitting from flower to flower
ever remains mine
I lose the one that is netted by me
Your voice free bird reaches my sleeping nest
and my drowsy wings dream
of a voyage to the light
above the clouds
I miss the meaning of my own part
in the play of life
because I know not of the parts
that others play
The flower sheds all its petals
and finds the fruit
I leave my songs behind me
to the bloom of the everreturning honeysuckles
and the joy of the wind from the south
Dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil
take part in the life of the forest
The mind ever seeks its words
from its sounds and silence
as the sky from its darkness and light
The unseen dark plays on his flute
and the rhythm of light
eddies into stars and suns
into thoughts and dreams
My songs are to sing
that I have loved Thy singing
When the voice of the Silent touches my words
I know him and therefore I know myself
My last salutations are to them
who knew me imperfect and loved me
Loves gift cannot be given
it waits to be accepted
When death comes and whispers to me
Thy days are ended
let me say to him I have lived in love
and not in mere time
He will ask Will thy songs remain 
I shall say I know not but this I know
that often when I sang I found my eternity
Let me light my lamp
say the star
and never debate
if it will help to remove the darkness
Before the end of my journey
may I reach within myself
the one which is the all
leaving the outer shell
to float away with the drifting multitude
upon the current of chance and change
Pluck this little flower and take it delay not I fear lest it
droop and drop into the dust
I may not find a place in thy garland but honour it with a touch of
pain from thy hand and pluck it I fear lest the day end before I am
aware and the time of offering go by
Though its colour be not deep and its smell be faint use this flower
in thy service and pluck it while there is time
O Fool try to carry thyself upon thy own shoulders
O beggar to come beg at thy own door
Leave all thy burdens on his hands who can bear all
and never look behind in regret
Thy desire at once puts out the light from the lamp it touches with its breath
It is unholytake not thy gifts through its unclean hands
Accept only what is offered by sacred love

By all means they try to hold me secure who love me in this world
But it is otherwise with thy love which is greater than theirs
and thou keepest me free
Lest I forget them they never venture to leave me alone
But day passes by after day and thou art not seen
If I call not thee in my prayers if I keep not thee in my heart
thy love for me still waits for my love
Freedom from fear is the freedom
I claim for you my motherland
Freedom from the burden of the ages bending your head
breaking your back blinding your eyes to the beckoning
call of the future
Freedom from the shackles of slumber wherewith
you fasten yourself in nights stillness
mistrusting the star that speaks of truths adventurous paths
freedom from the anarchy of destiny
whole sails are weakly yielded to the blind uncertain winds
and the helm to a hand ever rigid and cold as death
Freedom from the insult of dwelling in a puppets world
where movements are started through brainless wires
repeated through mindless habits
where figures wait with patience and obedience for the
master of show
to be stirred into a mimicry of life
Art thou abroad on this stormy night
on thy journey of love my friend
The sky groans like one in despair
I have no sleep tonight
Ever and again I open my door and look out on
the darkness my friend
I can see nothing before me
I wonder where lies thy path
By what dim shore of the inkblack river
by what far edge of the frowning forest
through what mazy depth of gloom art thou threading
thy course to come to me my friend

The I that floats along the wave of time
From a distance I watch him
With the dust and the water
With the fruit and the flower
With the All he is rushing forward
He is always on the surface
Tossed by the waves and dancing to the rhythm
Of joy and suffering
The least loss makes him suffer
The least wound hurts him
Him I see from afar
That I is not my real self
I am still within myself
I do not float in the stream of death
I am free I am desireless
I am peace I am illumined
Him I see from afar
Thou hast made me endless such is thy pleasure This frail vessel thou emptiest again and again and fillest it ever with fresh life
This little flute of a reed thou hast carried over hills and dales and hast breathed through it melodies eternally new
At the immortal touch of thy hands my little heart loses its limits in joy and gives birth to utterance ineffable
Thy infinite gifts come to me only on these very small hands of mine Ages pass and still thou pourest and still there is room to fill
When thou commandest me to sing it seems that my heart would break with pride and I look to thy face and tears come to my eyes
All that is harsh and dissonant in my life melts into one sweet harmony and my adoration spreads wings like a glad bird on its flight across the sea
I know thou takest pleasure in my singing I know that only as a singer I come before thy presence
I touch by the edge of the farspreading wing of my song thy feet which I could never aspire to reach
Drunk with the joy of singing I forget myself and call thee friend who art my lord
I know not how thou singest my master I ever listen in silent amazement
The light of thy music illumines the world The life breath of thy music runs from sky to sky The holy stream of thy music breaks through all stony obstacles and rushes on
My heart longs to join in thy song but vainly struggles for a voice I would speak but speech breaks not into song and I cry out baffled Ah thou hast made my heart captive in the endless meshes of thy music my master
Life of my life I shall ever try to keep my body pure knowing that thy living touch is upon all my limbs
I shall ever try to keep all untruths out from my thoughts knowing that thou art that truth which has kindled the light of reason in my mind
I shall ever try to drive all evils away from my heart and keep my love in flower knowing that thou hast thy seat in the inmost shrine of my heart
And it shall be my endeavour to reveal thee in my actions knowing it is thy power gives me strength to act
I ask for a moments indulgence to sit by thy side The works that I have in hand I will finish afterwards
Away from the sight of thy face my heart knows no rest nor respite and my work becomes an endless toil in a shoreless sea of toil
Today the summer has come at my window with its sighs and murmurs and the bees are plying their minstrelsy at the court of the flowering grove
Now it is time to sit quite face to face with thee and to sing dedication of life in this silent and overflowing leisure
Pluck this little flower and take it delay not I fear lest it droop and drop into the dust
I may not find a place in thy garland but honour it with a touch of pain from thy hand and pluck it I fear lest the day end before I am aware and the time of offering go by
Though its colour be not deep and its smell be faint use this flower in thy service and pluck it while there is time
My song has put off her adornments She has no pride of dress and decoration Ornaments would mar our union they would come between thee and me their jingling would drown thy whispers
My poets vanity dies in shame before thy sight O master poet I have sat down at thy feet Only let me make my life simple and straight like a flute of reed for thee to fill with music
The child who is decked with princes robes and who has jewelled chains round his neck loses all pleasure in his play his dress hampers him at every step
In fear that it may be frayed or stained with dust he keeps himself from the world and is afraid even to move
Mother it is no gain thy bondage of finery if it keeps one shut off from the healthful dust of the earth if it rob one of the right of entrance to the great fair of common human life
O Fool try to carry thyself upon thy own shoulders O beggar to come beg at thy own door
Leave all thy burdens on his hands who can bear all and never look behind in regret
Thy desire at once puts out the light from the lamp it touches with its breath It is unholy take not thy gifts through its unclean hands Accept only what is offered by sacred love
Here is thy footstool and there rest thy feet where live the poorest and lowliest and lost
When I try to bow to thee my obeisance cannot reach down to the depth where thy feet rest among the poorest and lowliest and lost
Pride can never approach to where thou walkest in the clothes of the humble among the poorest and lowliest and lost
My heart can never find its way to where thou keepest company with the companionless among the poorest the lowliest and the lost
Leave this chanting and singing and telling of beads Whom dost thou worship in this lonely dark corner of a temple with doors all shut Open thine eyes and see thy God is not before thee
He is there where the tiller is tilling the hard ground and where the pathmaker is breaking stones He is with them in sun and in shower and his garment is covered with dust Put of thy holy mantle and even like him come down on the dusty soil
Deliverance Where is this deliverance to be found Our master himself has joyfully taken upon him the bonds of creation he is bound with us all for ever
Come out of thy meditations and leave aside thy flowers and incense What harm is there if thy clothes become tattered and stained Meet him and stand by him in toil and in sweat of thy brow
The time that my journey takes is long and the way of it long
I came out on the chariot of the first gleam of light and pursued my voyage through the wildernesses of worlds leaving my track on many a star and planet
It is the most distant course that comes nearest to thyself and that training is the most intricate which leads to the utter simplicity of a tune
The traveller has to knock at every alien door to come to his own and one has to wander through all the outer worlds to reach the innermost shrine at the end
My eyes strayed far and wide before I shut them and said Here art thou
The question and the cry Oh where melt into tears of a thousand streams and deluge the world with the flood of the assurance I am
The song that I came to sing remains unsung to this day I have spent my days in stringing and in unstringing my instrument
The time has not come true the words have not been rightly set only there is the agony of wishing in my heart
The blossom has not opened only the wind is sighing by I have not seen his face nor have I listened to his voice only I have heard his gentle footsteps from the road before my house
The livelong day has passed in spreading his seat on the floor but the lamp has not been lit and I cannot ask him into my house
I live in the hope of meeting with him but this meeting is not yet
My desires are many and my cry is pitiful but ever didst thou save me by hard refusals and this strong mercy has been wrought into my life through and through
Day by day thou art making me worthy of the simple great gifts that thou gavest to me unasked this sky and the light this body and the life and the mind saving me from perils of overmuch desire
There are times when I languidly linger and times when I awaken and hurry in search of my goal but cruelly thou hidest thyself from before me
Day by day thou art making me worthy of thy full acceptance by refusing me ever and anon saving me from perils of weak uncertain desire
I am here to sing thee songs In this hall of thine I have a corner seat
In thy world I have no work to do my useless life can only break out in tunes without a purpose
When the hour strikes for thy silent worship at the dark temple of midnight command me my master to stand before thee to sing
When in the morning air the golden harp is tuned honour me commanding my presence
I have had my invitation to this worlds festival and thus my life has been blessed My eyes have seen and my ears have heard
It was my part at this feast to play upon my instrument and I have done all I could
Now I ask has the time come at last when I may go in and see thy face and offer thee my silent salutation
I am only waiting for love to give myself up at last into his hands That is why it is so late and why I have been guilty of such omissions
They come with their laws and their codes to bind me fast but I evade them ever for I am only waiting for love to give myself up at last into his hands
People blame me and call me heedless I doubt not they are right in their blame
The market day is over and work is all done for the busy Those who came to call me in vain have gone back in anger I am only waiting for love to give myself up at last into his hands
Clouds heap upon clouds and it darkens Ah love why dost thou let me wait outside at the door all alone
In the busy moments of the noontide work I am with the crowd but on this dark lonely day it is only for thee that I hope
If thou showest me not thy face if thou leavest me wholly aside I know not how I am to pass these long rainy hours
I keep gazing on the faraway gloom of the sky and my heart wanders wailing with the restless wind
If thou speakest not I will fill my heart with thy silence and endure it I will keep still and wait like the night with starry vigil and its head bent low with patience
The morning will surely come the darkness will vanish and thy voice pour down in golden streams breaking through the sky
Then thy words will take wing in songs from every one of my birds nests and thy melodies will break forth in flowers in all my forest groves
On the day when the lotus bloomed alas my mind was straying and I knew it not My basket was empty and the flower remained unheeded
Only now and again a sadness fell upon me and I started up from my dream and felt a sweet trace of a strange fragrance in the south wind
That vague sweetness made my heart ache with longing and it seemed to me that is was the eager breath of the summer seeking for its completion
I knew not then that it was so near that it was mine and that this perfect sweetness had blossomed in the depth of my own heart
I must launch out my boat The languid hours pass by on the shore Alas for me
The spring has done its flowering and taken leave And now with the burden of faded futile flowers I wait and linger
The waves have become clamorous and upon the bank in the shady lane the yellow leaves flutter and fall
What emptiness do you gaze upon Do you not feel a thrill passing through the air with the notes of the faraway song floating from the other shore
In the deep shadows of the rainy July with secret steps thou walkest silent as night eluding all watchers
Today the morning has closed its eyes heedless of the insistent calls of the loud east wind and a thick veil has been drawn over the everwakeful blue sky
The woodlands have hushed their songs and doors are all shut at every house Thou art the solitary wayfarer in this deserted street Oh my only friend my best beloved the gates are open in my house do not pass by like a dream
Art thou abroad on this stormy night on thy journey of love my friend The sky groans like one in despair
I have no sleep tonight Ever and again I open my door and look out on the darkness my friend
I can see nothing before me I wonder where lies thy path
By what dim shore of the inkblack river by what far edge of the frowning forest through what mazy depth of gloom art thou threading thy course to come to me my friend
If the day is done if birds sing no more if the wind has flagged tired then draw the veil of darkness thick upon me even as thou hast wrapt the earth with the coverlet of sleep and tenderly closed the petals of the drooping lotus at dusk
From the traveller whose sack of provisions is empty before the voyage is ended whose garment is torn and dustladen whose strength is exhausted remove shame and poverty and renew his life like a flower under the cover of thy kindly night
In the night of weariness let me give myself up to sleep without struggle resting my trust upon thee
Let me not force my flagging spirit into a poor preparation for thy worship
It is thou who drawest the veil of night upon the tired eyes of the day to renew its sight in a fresher gladness of awakening
He came and sat by my side but I woke not What a cursed sleep it was O miserable me
He came when the night was still he had his harp in his hands and my dreams became resonant with its melodies
Alas why are my nights all thus lost Ah why do I ever miss his sight whose breath touches my sleep
Light oh where is the light Kindle it with the burning fire of desire
There is the lamp but never a flicker of a flame is such thy fate my heart Ah death were better by far for thee
Misery knocks at thy door and her message is that thy lord is wakeful and he calls thee to the lovetryst through the darkness of night
The sky is overcast with clouds and the rain is ceaseless I know not what this is that stirs in me I know not its meaning
A moments flash of lightning drags down a deeper gloom on my sight and my heart gropes for the path to where the music of the night calls me
Light oh where is the light Kindle it with the burning fire of desire It thunders and the wind rushes screaming through the void The night is black as a black stone Let not the hours pass by in the dark Kindle the lamp of love with thy life
Obstinate are the trammels but my heart aches when I try to break them
Freedom is all I want but to hope for it I feel ashamed
I am certain that priceless wealth is in thee and that thou art my best friend but I have not the heart to sweep away the tinsel that fills my room
The shroud that covers me is a shroud of dust and death I hate it yet hug it in love
My debts are large my failures great my shame secret and heavy yet when I come to ask for my good I quake in fear lest my prayer be granted
He whom I enclose with my name is weeping in this dungeon I am ever busy building this wall all around and as this wall goes up into the sky day by day I lose sight of my true being in its dark shadow
I take pride in this great wall and I plaster it with dust and sand lest a least hole should be left in this name and for all the care I take I lose sight of my true being
I came out alone on my way to my tryst But who is this that follows me in the silent dark
I move aside to avoid his presence but I escape him not
He makes the dust rise from the earth with his swagger he adds his loud voice to every word that I utter
He is my own little self my lord he knows no shame but I am ashamed to come to thy door in his company
Prisoner tell me who was it that bound you
It was my master said the prisoner I thought I could outdo everybody in the world in wealth and power and I amassed in my own treasurehouse the money due to my king When sleep overcame me I lay upon the bad that was for my lord and on waking up I found I was a prisoner in my own treasurehouse
Prisoner tell me who was it that wrought this unbreakable chain
It was I said the prisoner who forged this chain very carefully I thought my invincible power would hold the world captive leaving me in a freedom undisturbed Thus night and day I worked at the chain with huge fires and cruel hard strokes When at last the work was done and the links were complete and unbreakable I found that it held me in its grip
By all means they try to hold me secure who love me in this world But it is otherwise with thy love which is greater than theirs and thou keepest me free
Lest I forget them they never venture to leave me alone But day passes by after day and thou art not seen
If I call not thee in my prayers if I keep not thee in my heart thy love for me still waits for my love
When it was day they came into my house and said We shall only take the smallest room here
They said We shall help you in the worship of your God and humbly accept only our own share in his grace and then they took their seat in a corner and they sat quiet and meek
But in the darkness of night I find they break into my sacred shrine strong and turbulent and snatch with unholy greed the offerings from Gods altar
Let only that little be left of me whereby I may name thee my all
Let only that little be left of my will whereby I may feel thee on every side and come to thee in everything and offer to thee my love every moment
Let only that little be left of me whereby I may never hide thee
Let only that little of my fetters be left whereby I am bound with thy will and thy purpose is carried out in my life and that is the fetter of thy love
Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high Where knowledge is free Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls Where words come out from the depth of truth Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit Where the mind is led forward by thee into everwidening thought and action Into that heaven of freedom my Father let my country awake
This is my prayer to thee my lord strike strike at the root of penury in my heart Give me the strength lightly to bear my joys and sorrows Give me the strength to make my love fruitful in service Give me the strength never to disown the poor or bend my knees before insolent might Give me the strength to raise my mind high above daily trifles And give me the strength to surrender my strength to thy will with love
I thought that my voyage had come to its end at the last limit of my power that the path before me was closed that provisions were exhausted and the time come to take shelter in a silent obscurity
But I find that thy will knows no end in me And when old words die out on the tongue new melodies break forth from the heart and where the old tracks are lost new country is revealed with its wonders
That I want thee only thee let my heart repeat without end All desires that distract me day and night are false and empty to the core
As the night keeps hidden in its gloom the petition for light even thus in the depth of my unconsciousness rings the cry I want thee only thee
As the storm still seeks its end in peace when it strikes against peace with all its might even thus my rebellion strikes against thy love and still its cry is I want thee only thee
When the heart is hard and parched up come upon me with a shower of mercy
When grace is lost from life come with a burst of song
When tumultuous work raises its din on all sides shutting me out from beyond come to me my lord of silence with thy peace and rest
When my beggarly heart sits crouched shut up in a corner break open the door my king and come with the ceremony of a king
When desire blinds the mind with delusion and dust O thou holy one thou wakeful come with thy light and thy thunder
The rain has held back for days and days my God in my arid heart The horizon is fiercely naked not the thinnest cover of a soft cloud not the vaguest hint of a distant cool shower
Send thy angry storm dark with death if it is thy wish and with lashes of lightning startle the sky from end to end
But call back my lord call back this pervading silent heat still and keen and cruel burning the heart with dire despair
Let the cloud of grace bend low from above like the tearful look of the mother on the day of the fathers wrath
Where dost thou stand behind them all my lover hiding thyself in the shadows They push thee and pass thee by on the dusty road taking thee for naught I wait here weary hours spreading my offerings for thee while passersby come and take my flowers one by one and my basket is nearly empty
The morning time is past and the noon In the shade of evening my eyes are drowsy with sleep Men going home glance at me and smile and fill me with shame I sit like a beggar maid drawing my skirt over my face and when they ask me what it is I want I drop my eyes and answer them not
Oh how indeed could I tell them that for thee I wait and that thou hast promised to come How could I utter for shame that I keep for my dowry this poverty Ah I hug this pride in the secret of my heart
I sit on the grass and gaze upon the sky and dream of the sudden splendour of thy coming all the lights ablaze golden pennons flying over thy car and they at the roadside standing agape when they see thee come down from thy seat to raise me from the dust and set at thy side this ragged beggar girl atremble with shame and pride like a creeper in a summer breeze
But time glides on and still no sound of the wheels of thy chariot Many a procession passes by with noise and shouts and glamour of glory Is it only thou who wouldst stand in the shadow silent and behind them all And only I who would wait and weep and wear out my heart in vain longing
Early in the day it was whispered that we should sail in a boat only thou and I and never a soul in the world would know of this our pilgrimage to no country and to no end
In that shoreless ocean at thy silently listening smile my songs would swell in melodies free as waves free from all bondage of words
Is the time not come yet Are there works still to do Lo the evening has come down upon the shore and in the fading light the seabirds come flying to their nests
Who knows when the chains will be off and the boat like the last glimmer of sunset vanish into the night
The day was when I did not keep myself in readiness for thee and entering my heart unbidden even as one of the common crowd unknown to me my king thou didst press the signet of eternity upon many a fleeting moment of my life
And today when by chance I light upon them and see thy signature I find they have lain scattered in the dust mixed with the memory of joys and sorrows of my trivial days forgotten
Thou didst not turn in contempt from my childish play among dust and the steps that I heard in my playroom are the same that are echoing from star to star
This is my delight thus to wait and watch at the wayside where shadow chases light and the rain comes in the wake of the summer
Messengers with tidings from unknown skies greet me and speed along the road My heart is glad within and the breath of the passing breeze is sweet
From dawn till dusk I sit here before my door and I know that of a sudden the happy moment will arrive when I shall see
In the meanwhile I smile and I sing all alone In the meanwhile the air is filling with the perfume of promise
Have you not heard his silent steps He comes comes ever comes
Every moment and every age every day and every night he comes comes ever comes
Many a song have I sung in many a mood of mind but all their notes have always proclaimed He comes comes ever comes
In the fragrant days of sunny April through the forest path he comes comes ever comes
In the rainy gloom of July nights on the thundering chariot of clouds he comes comes ever comes
In sorrow after sorrow it is his steps that press upon my heart and it is the golden touch of his feet that makes my joy to shine

I know not from what distant time thou art ever coming nearer to meet me Thy sun and stars can never keep thee hidden from me for aye
In many a morning and eve thy footsteps have been heard and thy messenger has come within my heart and called me in secret
I know not only why today my life is all astir and a feeling of tremulous joy is passing through my heart
It is as if the time were come to wind up my work and I feel in the air a faint smell of thy sweet presence
The night is nearly spent waiting for him in vain I fear lest in the morning he suddenly come to my door when I have fallen asleep wearied out Oh friends leave the way open to him forbid him not
If the sounds of his steps does not wake me do not try to rouse me I pray I wish not to be called from my sleep by the clamorous choir of birds by the riot of wind at the festival of morning light Let me sleep undisturbed even if my lord comes of a sudden to my door
Ah my sleep precious sleep which only waits for his touch to vanish Ah my closed eyes that would open their lids only to the light of his smile when he stands before me like a dream emerging from darkness of sleep
Let him appear before my sight as the first of all lights and all forms The first thrill of joy to my awakened soul let it come from his glance And let my return to myself be immediate return to him
The morning sea of silence broke into ripples of bird songs and the flowers were all merry by the roadside and the wealth of gold was scattered through the rift of the clouds while we busily went on our way and paid no heed
We sang no glad songs nor played we went not to the village for barter we spoke not a word nor smiled we lingered not on the way We quickened our pave more and more as the time sped by
The sun rose to the mid sky and doves cooed in the shade Withered leaves danced and whirled in the hot air of noon The shepherd boy drowsed and dreamed in the shadow of the banyan tree and I laid myself down by the water and stretched my tired limbs on the grass
My companions laughed at me in scorn they held their heads high and hurried on they never looked back nor rested they vanished in the distant blue haze They crossed many meadows and hills and passed through strange faraway countries All honour to you heroic host of the interminable path Mockery and reproach pricked me to rise but found no response in me I gave myself up for lost in the depth of a glad humiliation in the shadow of a dim delight
The repose of the sunembroidered green gloom slowly spread over my heart I forgot for what I had travelled and I surrendered my mind without struggle to the maze of shadows and songs
At last when I woke from my slumber and opened my eyes I saw thee standing by me flooding my sleep with thy smile How I had feared that the path was long and wearisome and the struggle to reach thee was hard
You came down from your throne and stood at my cottage door
I was singing all alone in a corner and the melody caught your ear You came down and stood at my cottage door
Masters are many in your hall and songs are sung there at all hours But the simple carol of this novice struck at your love One plaintive little strain mingled with the great music of the world and with a flower for a prize you came down and stopped at my cottage door
I had gone abegging from door to door in the village path when thy golden chariot appeared in the distance like a gorgeous dream and I wondered who was this King of all kings
My hopes rose high and methought my evil days were at an end and I stood waiting for alms to be given unasked and for wealth scattered on all sides in the dust
The chariot stopped where I stood Thy glance fell on me and thou camest down with a smile I felt that the luck of my life had come at last Then of a sudden thou didst hold out thy right hand and say What hast thou to give to me
Ah what a kingly jest was it to open thy palm to a beggar to beg I was confused and stood undecided and then from my wallet I slowly took out the least little grain of corn and gave it to thee
But how great my surprise when at the days end I emptied my bag on the floor to find a least little gram of gold among the poor heap I bitterly wept and wished that I had had the heart to give thee my all
The night darkened Our days works had been done We thought that the last guest had arrived for the night and the doors in the village were all shut Only some said the king was to come We laughed and said No it cannot be
It seemed there were knocks at the door and we said it was nothing but the wind We put out the lamps and lay down to sleep Only some said It is the messenger We laughed and said No it must be the wind
There came a sound in the dead of the night We sleepily thought it was the distant thunder The earth shook the walls rocked and it troubled us in our sleep Only some said it was the sound of wheels We said in a drowsy murmur No it must be the rumbling of clouds
The night was still dark when the drum sounded The voice came Wake up delay not We pressed our hands on our hearts and shuddered with fear Some said Lo there is the kings flag We stood up on our feet and cried There is no time for delay
The king has come but where are lights where are wreaths Where is the throne to seat him Oh shame Oh utter shame Where is the hall the decorations Someone has said Vain is this cry Greet him with empty hands lead him into thy rooms all bare
Open the doors let the conchshells be sounded in the depth of the night has come the king of our dark dreary house The thunder roars in the sky The darkness shudders with lightning Bring out thy tattered piece of mat and spread it in the courtyard With the storm has come of a sudden our king of the fearful night
I thought I should ask of thee but I dared not the rose wreath thou hadst on thy neck Thus I waited for the morning when thou didst depart to find a few fragments on the bed And like a beggar I searched in the dawn only for a stray petal or two
Ah me what is it I find What token left of thy love It is no flower no spices no vase of perfumed water It is thy mighty sword flashing as a flame heavy as a bolt of thunder The young light of morning comes through the window and spread itself upon thy bed The morning bird twitters and asks Woman what hast thou got No it is no flower nor spices nor vase of perfumed water it is thy dreadful sword
I sit and muse in wonder what gift is this of thine I can find no place to hide it I am ashamed to wear it frail as I am and it hurts me when press it to my bosom Yet shall I bear in my heart this honour of the burden of pain this gift of thine
From now there shall be no fear left for me in this world and thou shalt be victorious in all my strife Thou hast left death for my companion and I shall crown him with my life Thy sword is with me to cut asunder my bonds and there shall be no fear left for me in the world
From now I leave off all petty decorations Lord of my heart no more shall there be for me waiting and weeping in corners no more coyness and sweetness of demeanour Thou hast given me thy sword for adornment No more dolls decorations for me
Beautiful is thy wristlet decked with stars and cunningly wrought in myriadcoloured jewels But more beautiful to me thy sword with its curve of lightning like the outspread wings of the divine bird of Vishnu perfectly poised in the angry red light of the sunset
It quivers like the one last response of life in ecstasy of pain at the final stroke of death it shines like the pure flame of being burning up earty sense with one fierce flash
Beautiful is thy wristlet decked with starry gems but thy sword O lord of thunder is wrought with uttermost beauty terrible to behold or think of
I asked nothing from thee I uttered not my name to thine ear When thou tookst thy leave I stood silent I was alone by the well where the shadow of the tree fell aslant and the women had gone home with their brown earthen pitchers full to the brim They called me and shouted Come with us the morning is wearing on to noon But I languidly lingered awhile lost in the midst of vague musings
I heard not thy steps as thou camest Thine eyes were sad when they fell on me thy voice was tired as thou spokest low Ah I am a thirsty traveller I started up from my daydreams and poured water from my jar on thy joined palms The leaves rustled overhead the cuckoo sang from the unseen dark and perfume of babla flowers came from the bend of the road
I stood speecess with shame when my name thou didst ask Indeed what had I done for thee to keep me in remembrance But the memory that I could give water to thee to allay thy thirst will cling to my heart and enfold it in sweetness The morning hour is late the bird sings in weary notes neem leaves rustle overhead and I sit and think and think
Languor is upon your heart and the slumber is still on your eyes
Has not the word come to you that the flower is reigning in splendour among thorns Wake oh awaken let not the time pass in vain
At the end of the stony path in the country of virgin solitude my friend is sitting all alone Deceive him not Wake oh awaken
What if the sky pants and trembles with the heat of the midday sun what if the burning sand spreads its mantle of thirst
Is there no joy in the deep of your heart At every footfall of yours will not the harp of the road break out in sweet music of pain
Thus it is that thy joy in me is so full Thus it is that thou hast come down to me O thou lord of all heavens where would be thy love if I were not
Thou hast taken me as thy partner of all this wealth In my heart is the endless play of thy delight In my life thy will is ever taking shape
And for this thou who art the King of kings hast decked thyself in beauty to captivate my heart And for this thy love loses itself in the love of thy lover and there art thou seen in the perfect union of two
Light my light the worldfilling light the eyekissing light heartsweetening light
Ah the light dances my darling at the centre of my life the light strikes my darling the chords of my love the sky opens the wind runs wild laughter passes over the earth
The butterflies spread their sails on the sea of light Lilies and jasmines surge up on the crest of the waves of light
The light is shattered into gold on every cloud my darling and it scatters gems in profusion
Mirth spreads from leaf to leaf my darling and gladness without measure The heavens river has drowned its banks and the flood of joy is abroad
Let all the strains of joy mingle in my last song the joy that makes the earth flow over in the riotous excess of the grass the joy that sets the twin brothers life and death dancing over the wide world the joy that sweeps in with the tempest shaking and waking all life with laughter the joy that sits still with its tears on the open red lotus of pain and the joy that throws everything it has upon the dust and knows not a word
Yes I know this is nothing but thy love O beloved of my heart this golden light that dances upon the leaves these idle clouds sailing across the sky this passing breeze leaving its coolness upon my forehead
The morning light has flooded my eyes this is thy message to my heart Thy face is bent from above thy eyes look down on my eyes and my heart has touched thy feet
On the seashore of endless worlds children meet The infinite sky is motionless overhead and the restless water is boisterous On the seashore of endless worlds the children meet with shouts and dances
They build their houses with sand and they play with empty shells With withered leaves they weave their boats and smilingly float them on the vast deep Children have their play on the seashore of worlds
They know not how to swim they know not how to cast nets Pearl fishers dive for pearls merchants sail in their ships while children gather pebbles and scatter them again they seek not for hidden treasures they know not how to cast nets
The sea surges up with laughter and pale gleams the smile of the sea beach Deathdealing waves sing meaningless ballads to the children even like a mother while rocking her babys cradle The sea plays with children and pale gleams the smile of the sea beach
On the seashore of endless worlds children meet Tempest roams in the patess sky ships get wrecked in the trackless water death is abroad and children play On the seashore of endless worlds is the great meeting of children
The sleep that flits on babys eyes does anybody know from where it comes Yes there is a rumour that it has its dwelling where in the fairy village among shadows of the forest dimly lit with glowworms there hang two timid buds of enchantment From there it comes to kiss babys eyes
The smile that flickers on babys lips when he sleeps does anybody know where it was born Yes there is a rumour that a young pale beam of a crescent moon touched the edge of a vanishing autumn cloud and there the smile was first born in the dream of a dewwashed morning the smile that flickers on babys lips when he sleeps
The sweet soft freshness that blooms on babys limbs does anybody know where it was hidden so long Yes when the mother was a young girl it lay pervading her heart in tender and silent mystery of love the sweet soft freshness that has bloomed on babys limbs
When I bring to you coloured toys my child I understand why there is such a play of colours on clouds on water and why flowers are painted in tints when I give coloured toys to you my child
When I sing to make you dance I truly now why there is music in leaves and why waves send their chorus of voices to the heart of the listening earth when I sing to make you dance
When I bring sweet things to your greedy hands I know why there is honey in the cup of the flowers and why fruits are secretly filled with sweet juice when I bring sweet things to your greedy hands
When I kiss your face to make you smile my darling I surely understand what pleasure streams from the sky in morning light and what delight that is that is which the summer breeze brings to my body when I kiss you to make you smile
Thou hast made me known to friends whom I knew not Thou hast given me seats in homes not my own Thou hast brought the distant near and made a brother of the stranger
I am uneasy at heart when I have to leave my accustomed shelter I forget that there abides the old in the new and that there also thou abidest
Through birth and death in this world or in others wherever thou leadest me it is thou the same the one companion of my endless life who ever linkest my heart with bonds of joy to the unfamiliar
When one knows thee then alien there is none then no door is shut Oh grant me my prayer that I may never lose the bliss of the touch of the one in the play of many
On the slope of the desolate river among tall grasses I asked her Maiden where do you go shading your lamp with your mantle My house is all dark and lonesome lend me your light she raised her dark eyes for a moment and looked at my face through the dusk I have come to the river she said to float my lamp on the stream when the daylight wanes in the west I stood alone among tall grasses and watched the timid flame of her lamp uselessly drifting in the tide
In the silence of gathering night I asked her Maiden your lights are all lit then where do you go with your lamp My house is all dark and lonesome lend me your light She raised her dark eyes on my face and stood for a moment doubtful I have come she said at last to dedicate my lamp to the sky I stood and watched her light uselessly burning in the void
In the moonless gloom of midnight I ask her Maiden what is your quest holding the lamp near your heart My house is all dark and lonesome lend me your light She stopped for a minute and thought and gazed at my face in the dark I have brought my light she said to join the carnival of lamps I stood and watched her little lamp uselessly lost among lights
What divine drink wouldst thou have my God from this overflowing cup of my life
My poet is it thy delight to see thy creation through my eyes and to stand at the portals of my ears silently to listen to thine own eternal harmony
Thy world is weaving words in my mind and thy joy is adding music to them Thou givest thyself to me in love and then feelest thine own entire sweetness in me
She who ever had remained in the depth of my being in the twilight of gleams and of glimpses she who never opened her veils in the morning light will be my last gift to thee my God folded in my final song
Words have wooed yet failed to win her persuasion has stretched to her its eager arms in vain
I have roamed from country to country keeping her in the core of my heart and around her have risen and fallen the growth and decay of my life
Over my thoughts and actions my slumbers and dreams she reigned yet dwelled alone and apart
many a man knocked at my door and asked for her and turned away in despair
There was none in the world who ever saw her face to face and she remained in her loneliness waiting for thy recognition
Thou art the sky and thou art the nest as well
O thou beautiful there in the nest is thy love that encloses the soul with colours and sounds and odours
There comes the morning with the golden basket in her right hand bearing the wreath of beauty silently to crown the earth
And there comes the evening over the lonely meadows deserted by herds through trackless paths carrying cool draughts of peace in her golden pitcher from the western ocean of rest
But there where spreads the infinite sky for the soul to take her flight in reigns the stainless white radiance There is no day nor night nor form nor colour and never never a word
Thy sunbeam comes upon this earth of mine with arms outstretched and stands at my door the livelong day to carry back to thy feet clouds made of my tears and sighs and songs
With fond delight thou wrappest about thy starry breast that mantle of misty cloud turning it into numberless shapes and folds and colouring it with hues everchanging
It is so light and so fleeting tender and tearful and dark that is why thou lovest it O thou spotless and serene And that is why it may cover thy awful white light with its pathetic shadows
The same stream of life that runs through my veins night and day runs through the world and dances in rhythmic measures
It is the same life that shoots in joy through the dust of the earth in numberless blades of grass and breaks into tumultuous waves of leaves and flowers
It is the same life that is rocked in the oceancradle of birth and of death in ebb and in flow
I feel my limbs are made glorious by the touch of this world of life And my pride is from the lifethrob of ages dancing in my blood this moment
Is it beyond thee to be glad with the gladness of this rhythm to be tossed and lost and broken in the whirl of this fearful joy
All things rush on they stop not they look not behind no power can hold them back they rush on
Keeping steps with that restless rapid music seasons come dancing and pass away colours tunes and perfumes pour in endless cascades in the abounding joy that scatters and gives up and dies every moment
That I should make much of myself and turn it on all sides thus casting coloured shadows on thy radiance such is thy maya
Thou settest a barrier in thine own being and then callest thy severed self in myriad notes This thy selfseparation has taken body in me
The poignant song is echoed through all the sky in manycoloured tears and smiles alarms and hopes waves rise up and sink again dreams break and form In me is thy own defeat of self
This screen that thou hast raised is painted with innumerable figures with the brush of the night and the day Behind it thy seat is woven in wondrous mysteries of curves casting away all barren lines of straightness
The great pageant of thee and me has overspread the sky With the tune of thee and me all the air is vibrant and all ages pass with the hiding and seeking of thee and me
He it is the innermost one who awakens my being with his deep hidden touches
He it is who puts his enchantment upon these eyes and joyfully plays on the chords of my heart in varied cadence of pleasure and pain
He it is who weaves the web of this maya in evanescent hues of gold and silver blue and green and lets peep out through the folds his feet at whose touch I forget myself
Days come and ages pass and it is ever he who moves my heart in many a name in many a guise in many a rapture of joy and of sorrow
Deliverance is not for me in renunciation I feel the embrace of freedom in a thousand bonds of delight
Thou ever pourest for me the fresh draught of thy wine of various colours and fragrance filling this earthen vessel to the brim
My world will light its hundred different lamps with thy flame and place them before the altar of thy temple
No I will never shut the doors of my senses The delights of sight and hearing and touch will bear thy delight
Yes all my illusions will burn into illumination of joy and all my desires ripen into fruits of love
The day is no more the shadow is upon the earth It is time that I go to the stream to fill my pitcher
The evening air is eager with the sad music of the water Ah it calls me out into the dusk In the lonely lane there is no passerby the wind is up the ripples are rampant in the river
I know not if I shall come back home I know not whom I shall chance to meet There at the fording in the little boat the unknown man plays upon his lute
Thy gifts to us mortals fulfil all our needs and yet run back to thee undiminished
The river has its everyday work to do and hastens through fields and hamlets yet its incessant stream winds towards the washing of thy feet
The flower sweetens the air with its perfume yet its last service is to offer itself to thee
Thy worship does not impoverish the world
From the words of the poet men take what meanings please them yet their last meaning points to thee
Day after day O lord of my life shall I stand before thee face to face With folded hands O lord of all worlds shall I stand before thee face to face
Under thy great sky in solitude and silence with humble heart shall I stand before thee face to face
In this laborious world of thine tumultuous with toil and with struggle among hurrying crowds shall I stand before thee face to face
And when my work shall be done in this world O King of kings alone and speecess shall I stand before thee face to face
I know thee as my God and stand apart I do not know thee as my own and come closer I know thee as my father and bow before thy feet I do not grasp thy hand as my friends
I stand not where thou comest down and ownest thyself as mine there to clasp thee to my heart and take thee as my comrade
Thou art the Brother amongst my brothers but I heed them not I divide not my earnings with them thus sharing my all with thee
In pleasure and in pain I stand not by the side of men and thus stand by thee I shrink to give up my life and thus do not plunge into the great waters of life
When the creation was new and all the stars shone in their first splendour the gods held their assembly in the sky and sang Oh the picture of perfection the joy unalloyed
But one cried of a sudden It seems that somewhere there is a break in the chain of light and one of the stars has been lost
The golden string of their harp snapped their song stopped and they cried in dismay Yes that lost star was the best she was the glory of all heavens
From that day the search is unceasing for her and the cry goes on from one to the other that in her the world has lost its one joy
Only in the deepest silence of night the stars smile and whisper among themselves Vain is this seeking unbroken perfection is over all
If it is not my portion to meet thee in this life then let me ever feel that I have missed thy sight let me not forget for a moment let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams and in my wakeful hours
As my days pass in the crowded market of this world and my hands grow full with the daily profits let me ever feel that I have gained nothing let me not forget for a moment let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams and in my wakeful hours
When I sit by the roadside tired and panting when I spread my bed low in the dust let me ever feel that the long journey is still before me let me not forget a moment let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams and in my wakeful hours
When my rooms have been decked out and the flutes sound and the laughter there is loud let me ever feel that I have not invited thee to my house let me not forget for a moment let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams and in my wakeful hours
I am like a remnant of a cloud of autumn uselessly roaming in the sky O my sun everglorious Thy touch has not yet melted my vapour making me one with thy light and thus I count months and years separated from thee
If this be thy wish and if this be thy play then take this fleeting emptiness of mine paint it with colours gild it with gold float it on the wanton wind and spread it in varied wonders
And again when it shall be thy wish to end this play at night I shall melt and vanish away in the dark or it may be in a smile of the white morning in a coolness of purity transparent
On many an idle day have I grieved over lost time But it is never lost my lord Thou hast taken every moment of my life in thine own hands
Hidden in the heart of things thou art nourishing seeds into sprouts buds into blossoms and ripening flowers into fruitfulness
I was tired and sleeping on my idle bed and imagined all work had ceased In the morning I woke up and found my garden full with wonders of flowers
Time is endless in thy hands my lord There is none to count thy minutes
Days and nights pass and ages bloom and fade like flowers Thou knowest how to wait
Thy centuries follow each other perfecting a small wild flower
We have no time to lose and having no time we must scramble for a chances We are too poor to be late
And thus it is that time goes by while I give it to every querulous man who claims it and thine altar is empty of all offerings to the last
At the end of the day I hasten in fear lest thy gate to be shut but I find that yet there is time
Mother I shall weave a chain of pearls for thy neck with my tears of sorrow
The stars have wrought their anklets of light to deck thy feet but mine will hang upon thy breast
Wealth and fame come from thee and it is for thee to give or to withhold them But this my sorrow is absolutely mine own and when I bring it to thee as my offering thou rewardest me with thy grace
It is the pang of separation that spreads throughout the world and gives birth to shapes innumerable in the infinite sky
It is this sorrow of separation that gazes in silence all nights from star to star and becomes lyric among rustling leaves in rainy darkness of July
It is this overspreading pain that deepens into loves and desires into sufferings and joy in human homes and this it is that ever melts and flows in songs through my poets heart
When the warriors came out first from their masters hall where had they hid their power Where were their armour and their arms
They looked poor and helpless and the arrows were showered upon them on the day they came out from their masters hall
When the warriors marched back again to their masters hall where did they hide their power
They had dropped the sword and dropped the bow and the arrow peace was on their foreheads and they had left the fruits of their life behind them on the day they marched back again to their masters hall
Death thy servant is at my door He has crossed the unknown sea and brought thy call to my home
The night is dark and my heart is fearful yet I will take up the lamp open my gates and bow to him my welcome It is thy messenger who stands at my door
I will worship him placing at his feet the treasure of my heart
He will go back with his errand done leaving a dark shadow on my morning and in my desolate home only my forlorn self will remain as my last offering to thee
In desperate hope I go and search for her in all the corners of my room I find her not
My house is small and what once has gone from it can never be regained
But infinite is thy mansion my lord and seeking her I have to come to thy door
I stand under the golden canopy of thine evening sky and I lift my eager eyes to thy face
I have come to the brink of eternity from which nothing can vanish no hope no happiness no vision of a face seen through tears
Oh dip my emptied life into that ocean plunge it into the deepest fullness Let me for once feel that lost sweet touch in the allness of the universe
Deity of the ruined temple The broken strings of Vina sing no more your praise The bells in the evening proclaim not your time of worship The air is still and silent about you
In your desolate dwelling comes the vagrant spring breeze It brings the tidings of flowers the flowers that for your worship are offered no more
Your worshipper of old wanders ever longing for favour still refused In the eventide when fires and shadows mingle with the gloom of dust he wearily comes back to the ruined temple with hunger in his heart
Many a festival day comes to you in silence deity of the ruined temple Many a night of worship goes away with lamp unlit
Many new images are built by masters of cunning art and carried to the holy stream of oblivion when their time is come
Only the deity of the ruined temple remains unworshipped in deatess neglect
No more noisy loud words from me such is my masters will Henceforth I deal in whispers The speech of my heart will be carried on in murmurings of a song
Men hasten to the Kings market All the buyers and sellers are there But I have my untimely leave in the middle of the day in the thick of work
Let then the flowers come out in my garden though it is not their time and let the midday bees strike up their lazy hum
Full many an hour have I spent in the strife of the good and the evil but now it is the pleasure of my playmate of the empty days to draw my heart on to him and I know not why is this sudden call to what useless inconsequence
On the day when death will knock at thy door what wilt thou offer to him
Oh I will set before my guest the full vessel of my life I will never let him go with empty hands
All the sweet vintage of all my autumn days and summer nights all the earnings and gleanings of my busy life will I place before him at the close of my days when death will knock at my door
O thou the last fulfilment of life Death my death come and whisper to me
Day after day I have kept watch for thee for thee have I borne the joys and pangs of life
All that I am that I have that I hope and all my love have ever flowed towards thee in depth of secrecy One final glance from thine eyes and my life will be ever thine own
The flowers have been woven and the garland is ready for the bridegroom After the wedding the bride shall leave her home and meet her lord alone in the solitude of night
I know that the day will come when my sight of this earth shall be lost and life will take its leave in silence drawing the last curtain over my eyes
Yet stars will watch at night and morning rise as before and hours heave like sea waves casting up pleasures and pains
When I think of this end of my moments the barrier of the moments breaks and I see by the light of death thy world with its careless treasures Rare is its lowliest seat rare is its meanest of lives
Things that I longed for in vain and things that I got let them pass Let me but truly possess the things that I ever spurned and overlooked
I have got my leave Bid me farewell my brothers I bow to you all and take my departure
Here I give back the keys of my door and I give up all claims to my house I only ask for last kind words from you
We were neighbours for long but I received more than I could give Now the day has dawned and the lamp that lit my dark corner is out A summons has come and I am ready for my journey
At this time of my parting wish me good luck my friends The sky is flushed with the dawn and my path lies beautiful
Ask not what I have with me to take there I start on my journey with empty hands and expectant heart
I shall put on my wedding garland Mine is not the redbrown dress of the traveller and though there are dangers on the way I have no fear in mind
The evening star will come out when my voyage is done and the plaintive notes of the twilight melodies be struck up from the Kings gateway
I was not aware of the moment when I first crossed the threshold of this life
What was the power that made me open out into this vast mystery like a bud in the forest at midnight
When in the morning I looked upon the light I felt in a moment that I was no stranger in this world that the inscrutable without name and form had taken me in its arms in the form of my own mother
Even so in death the same unknown will appear as ever known to me And because I love this life I know I shall love death as well
The child cries out when from the right breast the mother takes it away in the very next moment to find in the left one its consolation
When I go from hence let this be my parting word that what I have seen is unsurpassable
I have tasted of the hidden honey of this lotus that expands on the ocean of light and thus am I blessed let this be my parting word
In this playhouse of infinite forms I have had my play and here have I caught sight of him that is formless
My whole body and my limbs have thrilled with his touch who is beyond touch and if the end comes here let it come let this be my parting word
When my play was with thee I never questioned who thou wert I knew nor shyness nor fear my life was boisterous
In the early morning thou wouldst call me from my sleep like my own comrade and lead me running from glade to glade
On those days I never cared to know the meaning of songs thou sangest to me Only my voice took up the tunes and my heart danced in their cadence
Now when the playtime is over what is this sudden sight that is come upon me The world with eyes bent upon thy feet stands in awe with all its silent stars
I will deck thee with trophies garlands of my defeat It is never in my power to escape unconquered
I surely know my pride will go to the wall my life will burst its bonds in exceeding pain and my empty heart will sob out in music like a hollow reed and the stone will melt in tears
I surely know the hundred petals of a lotus will not remain closed for ever and the secret recess of its honey will be bared
From the blue sky an eye shall gaze upon me and summon me in silence Nothing will be left for me nothing whatever and utter death shall I receive at thy feet
When I give up the helm I know that the time has come for thee to take it What there is to do will be instantly done Vain is this struggle
Then take away your hands and silently put up with your defeat my heart and think it your good fortune to sit perfectly still where you are placed
These my lamps are blown out at every little puff of wind and trying to light them I forget all else again and again
But I shall be wise this time and wait in the dark spreading my mat on the floor and whenever it is thy pleasure my lord come silently and take thy seat here
I dive down into the depth of the ocean of forms hoping to gain the perfect pearl of the formless
No more sailing from harbour to harbour with this my weatherbeaten boat The days are long passed when my sport was to be tossed on waves
And now I am eager to die into the deatess
Into the audience hall by the fathomless abyss where swells up the music of toneless strings I shall take this harp of my life
I shall tune it to the notes of forever and when it has sobbed out its last utterance lay down my silent harp at the feet of the silent
Ever in my life have I sought thee with my songs It was they who led me from door to door and with them have I felt about me searching and touching my world
It was my songs that taught me all the lessons I ever learnt they showed me secret paths they brought before my sight many a star on the horizon of my heart
They guided me all the day long to the mysteries of the country of pleasure and pain and at last to what palace gate have the brought me in the evening at the end of my journey
I boasted among men that I had known you They see your pictures in all works of mine They come and ask me Who is he I know not how to answer them I say Indeed I cannot tell They blame me and they go away in scorn And you sit there smiling
I put my tales of you into lasting songs The secret gushes out from my heart They come and ask me Tell me all your meanings I know not how to answer them I say Ah who knows what they mean They smile and go away in utter scorn And you sit there smiling
In one salutation to thee my God let all my senses spread out and touch this world at thy feet
Like a raincloud of July hung low with its burden of unshed showers let all my mind bend down at thy door in one salutation to thee
Let all my songs gather together their diverse strains into a single current and flow to a sea of silence in one salutation to thee
Like a flock of homesick cranes flying night and day back to their mountain nests let all my life take its voyage to its eternal home in one salutation to thee
This is my prayer to thee my lordstrike
strike at the root of penury in my heart
Give me the strength lightly to bear my joys and sorrows
Give me the strength to make my love fruitful in service
Give me the strength never to disown the poor or bend my knees before insolent might
Give me the strength to raise my mind high above daily trifles
And give me the strength to surrender my strength to thy will with love

Music is silenced the dark descending slowly
Has stripped unending skies of all companions
Weariness grips your limbs and within the locked horizons
Dumbly ring the bells of hugely gathering fears
Still O bird O sightless bird
Not yet not yet the time to furl your wings
Its not melodious woodlands but the leaps and falls
Of an oceans drowsy booming
Not a grove bedecked with flowers but a tumult flecked with foam
Where is the shore that stored your buds and leaves
Where the nest and the branchs hold
Still O bird my sightless bird
Not yet not yet the time to furl your wings
Stretching in front of you the nights immensity
Hides the western hill where sleeps the distant sun
Still with bated breath the world is counting time and swimming
Across the shoreless dark a crescent moon
Has thinly just appeared upon the dim horizon
But O my bird O sightless bird
Not yet not yet the time to furl your wings
From upper skies the stars with pointing fingers
Intently watch your course and deaths impatience
Lashes at you from the deeps in swirling waves
And sad entreaties line the farthest shore
With hands outstretched and crooning Come O come
Still O bird O sightless bird
Not yet not yet the time to furl your wings
All that is past your fears and loves and hopes
All that is lost your words and lamentation
No longer yours a home nor a bed composed of flowers
For wings are all you have and the skys broadening countryard
And the dawn steeped in darkness lacking all direction
Dear bird my sightless bird
Not yet not yet the time to furl your wings
I wonder if I know him
In whose speech is my voice
In whose movement is my being
Whose skill is in my lines
Whose melody is in my songs
In joy and sorrow
I thought he was chained within me
Contained by tears and laughter
Work and play
I thought he was my very self
Coming to an end with my death
Why then in a flood of joy do I feel him
In the sight and touch of my beloved
This I beyond self I found
On the shores of the shining sea
Therefore I know
This I is not imprisoned within my bounds
Losing myself I find him
Beyond the borders of time and space
Through the Ages
I come to know his Shining Self
In the life of the seeker
In the voice of the poet
From the dark clouds pour the rains
I sit and think
Bearing so many forms so many names
I come down crossing the threshold
Of countless births and deaths
The Supreme undivided complete in himself
Embracing past and present
Dwells in Man
Within Him I shall find myself
The I that reaches everywhere
I am restless I am athirst for faraway things
My soul goes out in a longing to touch the skirt of the dim distance
O Great Beyond O the keen call of thy flute
I forget I ever forget that I have no wings to fly that I am bound in this spot evermore
I am eager and wakeful I am a stranger in a strange land
Thy breath comes to me whispering an impossible hope
Thy tongue is known to my heart as its very own
O Fartoseek O the keen call of thy flute
I forget I ever forget that I know not the way that I have not the winged horse
I am listless I am a wanderer in my heart
In the sunny haze of the languid hours what vast vision of thine takes shape in the blue of the sky
O Farthest end O the keen call of thy flute
I forget I ever forget that the gates are shut everywhere in the house where I dwell alone
In the morning I cast my net into the sea
I dragged up from the dark abyss things of strange aspect and strange beauty some shone like a smile some glistened like tears and some were flushed like the cheeks of a bride
When with the days burden I went home my love was sitting in the garden idly tearing the leaves of a flower
I hesitated for a moment and then placed at her feet all that I had dragged up and stood silent
She glanced at them and said What strange things are these I know not of what use they are
I bowed my head in shame and thought I have not fought for these I did not buy them in the market they are not fit gifts for her
Then the whole night through I flung them one by one into the street
In the morning travellers came they picked them up and carried them into far countries
XIV
I found a few old letters of mine carefully hidden in thy boxa few small toys for thy memory to play with With a timorous heart thou didst try to steal these trifles from the turbulent stream of time which washes away planets and stars and didst say “These are only mine” Alas there is no one now who can claim themwho is able to pay their price yet they are still here Is there no love in this world to rescue thee from utter loss even like this love of thine that saved these letters with such fond care
O woman thou camest for a moment to my side and touched me with the great mystery of the woman that there is in the heart of creationshe who ever gives back to God his own outflow of sweetness who is the eternal love and beauty and youth who dances in bubbling streams and sings in the morning light who with heaving waves suckles the thirsty earth and whose mercy melts in rain in whom the eternal one breaks in two in joy that can contain itself no more and overflows in the pain of love
IN the dusky path of a dream I went to seek the love who was mine in a former life
Her house stood at the end of a desolate street
In the evening breeze her pet peacock sat drowsing on its perch and the pigeons were silent in their corner
She set her lamp down by the portal and stood before me
She raised her large eyes to my face and mutely asked Are you well my friend
I tried to answer but our language had been lost and forgotten
I thought and thought our names would not come to my mind
Tears shone in her eyes She held up her right hand to me I took it and stood silent
Our lamp had flickered in the evening breeze and died
He it is the innermost one
who awakens my being with his deep hidden touches
He it is who puts his enchantment upon these eyes
and joyfully plays on the chords of my heart
in varied cadence of pleasure and pain
He it is who weaves the web of this maya
in evanescent hues of gold and silver blue and green
and lets peep out through the folds his feet
at whose touch I forget myself
Days come and ages pass
and it is ever he who moves my heart in many a name
in many a guise in many a rapture of joy and of sorrow

The time that my journey takes is long and the way of it long
I came out on the chariot of the first gleam of light and pursued my
voyage through the wildernesses of worlds leaving my track on many a star and planet
It is the most distant course that comes nearest to thyself
and that training is the most intricate which leads to the utter simplicity of a tune
The traveler has to knock at every alien door to come to his own
and one has to wander through all the outer worlds to reach the innermost shrine at the end
My eyes strayed far and wide before I shut them and said Here art thou
The question and the cry Oh where melt into tears of a thousand
streams and deluge the world with the flood of the assurance I am
II
Keep me fully glad with nothing Only take my hand in your hand
In the gloom of the deepening night take up my heart and play with it as you list Bind me close to you with nothing
I will spread myself out at your feet and lie still Under this clouded sky I will meet silence with silence I will become one with the night clasping the earth in my breast
Make my life glad with nothing
The rains sweep the sky from end to end Jasmines in the wet untamable wind revel in their own perfume The cloudhidden stars thrill in secret Let me fill to the full my heart with nothing but my own depth of joy
In the village they call her the dark girl
but to me she is the flower Krishnakali
On a cloudy day in a field
I saw the dark girls dark gazelleeyes
She had no covering on her head
her loose hair had fallen on her back
Dark However dark she be
I have seen her dark gazelleeyes
Two black cows were lowing
as it grew dark under the heavy clouds
So with anxious hurried steps
the dark girl came from her hut
Raising her eyebrows toward the sky
she listened a moment to the clouds rumble
Dark However dark she be
I have seen her dark gazelleeyes
A gust of the east wind
rippled the rice plants
I was standing by a ridge
alone in the field
Whether or not she looked at me
Is known only to us two
Dark However dark she be
I have seen her dark gazelleeyes
This how the Kohldark cloud
rises in the northeast in Jaistha
the soft dark shadow
descends on the Tamal grove in Asharh
and sudden delight floods the heart
in the night of Sravan
Dark However dark she be
I have seen her dark gazelleeyes
To me she is the flower Krishnakali
whatever she may be called by others
In a field in Maynapara village
I saw the dark girls dark gazelleeyes
She did not cover her head
not having the time to feel embarrassed
Dark However dark she be
I have seen her dark gazelleeyes
Light oh where is the light
Kindle it with the burning fire of desire
There is the lamp but never a flicker of a flameis such thy fate my heart
Ah death were better by far for thee
Misery knocks at thy door
and her message is that thy lord is wakeful
and he calls thee to the lovetryst through the darkness of night
The sky is overcast with clouds and the rain is ceaseless
I know not what this is that stirs in meI know not its meaning
A moments flash of lightning drags down a deeper gloom on my sight
and my heart gropes for the path to where the music of the night calls me
Light oh where is the light
Kindle it with the burning fire of desire
It thunders and the wind rushes screaming through the void
The night is black as a black stone
Let not the hours pass by in the dark
Kindle the lamp of love with thy life
I know that the day will come
when my sight of this earth shall be lost
and life will take its leave in silence
drawing the last curtain over my eyes
Yet stars will watch at night
and morning rise as before
and hours heave like sea waves casting up pleasures and pains
When I think of this end of my moments
the barrier of the moments breaks
and I see by the light of death
thy world with its careless treasures
Rare is its lowliest seat
rare is its meanest of lives
Things that I longed for in vain
and things that I got
let them pass
Let me but truly possess
the things that I ever spurned
and overlooked

Leave this chanting and singing and telling of beads
Whom dost thou worship in this lonely dark corner of a temple with doors all shut
Open thine eyes and see thy God is not before thee
He is there where the tiller is tilling the hard ground
and where the pathmaker is breaking stones
He is with them in sun and in shower
and his garment is covered with dust
Put off thy holy mantle and even like him come down on the dusty soil
Deliverance
Where is this deliverance to be found
Our master himself has joyfully taken upon him the bonds of creation
he is bound with us all for ever
Come out of thy meditations and leave aside thy flowers and incense
What harm is there if thy clothes become tattered and stained
Meet him and stand by him in toil and in sweat of thy brow
If it is not my portion to meet thee in this life
then let me ever feel that I have missed thy sight
let me not forget for a moment
let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams
and in my wakeful hours
As my days pass in the crowded market of this world
and my hands grow full with the daily profits
let me ever feel that I have gained nothing
let me not forget for a moment
let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams
and in my wakeful hours
When I sit by the roadside tired and panting
when I spread my bed low in the dust
let me ever feel that the long journey is still before me
let me not forget a moment
let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams
and in my wakeful hours
When my rooms have been decked out and the flutes sound
and the laughter there is loud
let me ever feel that I have not invited thee to my house
let me not forget for a moment
let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams
and in my wakeful hours

Light my light the worldfilling light
the eyekissing light
heartsweetening light
Ah the light dances my darling at the center of my life
the light strikes my darling the chords of my love
the sky opens the wind runs wild laughter passes over the earth
The butterflies spread their sails on the sea of light
Lilies and jasmines surge up on the crest of the waves of light
The light is shattered into gold on every cloud my darling
and it scatters gems in profusion
Mirth spreads from leaf to leaf my darling
and gladness without measure
The heavens river has drowned its banks
and the flood of joy is abroad
Thou hast made me endless such is thy pleasure This frail
vessel thou emptiest again and again and fillest it ever with fresh life
This little flute of a reed thou hast carried over hills and dales
and hast breathed through it melodies eternally new
At the immortal touch of thy hands my little heart loses its limits in
joy and gives birth to utterance ineffable
Thy infinite gifts come to me only on these very small hands of mine
Ages pass and still thou pourest and still there is room to fill
Let only that little be left of me
whereby I may name thee my all
Let only that little be left of my will
whereby I may feel thee on every side
and come to thee in everything
and offer to thee my love every moment
Let only that little be left of me
whereby I may never hide thee
Let only that little of my fetters be left
whereby I am bound with thy will
and thy purpose is carried out in my lifeand that is the fetter of thy love

Thou who art the innermost Spirit of my being
art thou pleased Lord of my Life
For I give to thee my cup filled with all
the pain and delight that the crushed
grapes of my heart had surrendered
I wove with rhythm of colors and song cover for thy bed
And with the molten gold of my desires
I fashioned playthings for thy passing hours
I know not why thou chosest me for thy partner
Lord of my life
Didst thou store my days and nights
my deeds and dreams for the alchemy of thy art
and string in the chain of thy music my songs of autumn and spring
and gather the flowers from my mature moments for thy crown
I see thine eyes gazing at the dark of my heart
Lord of my life
I wonder if my failure and wrongs are forgiven
For many were my days without service
and nights of forgetfulness futile were the flowers
that faded in the shade not offered to thee
Often the tied strings of my lute slackened
at the strains of thy tunes
And often at the ruin of wasted hours
my desolate evenings were filled with tears
But have my days come to their end at last
Lord of my life while my arms round thee
grow limp my kisses losing their truth
Then break up the meeting of this languid day
Renew the old in me in fresh forms of delight
and let the wedding come once again in
a new ceremony of life
When the creation was new and all the stars shone in their first
splendor the gods held their assembly in the sky and sang
Oh the picture of perfection the joy unalloyed
But one cried of a sudden
It seems that somewhere there is a break in the chain of light
and one of the stars has been lost
The golden string of their harp snapped
their song stopped and they cried in dismay
Yes that lost star was the best
she was the glory of all heavens
From that day the search is unceasing for her
and the cry goes on from one to the other
that in her the world has lost its one joy
Only in the deepest silence of night the stars smile
and whisper among themselves
Vain is this seeking unbroken perfection is over all
On many an idle day have I grieved over lost time
But it is never lost my lord
Thou hast taken every moment of my life in thine own hands
Hidden in the heart of things thou art nourishing seeds into sprouts
buds into blossoms and ripening flowers into fruitfulness
I was tired and sleeping on my idle bed
and imagined all work had ceased
In the morning I woke up
and found my garden full with wonders of flowers

On the day when the lotus bloomed alas my mind was straying
and I knew it not My basket was empty and the flower remained unheeded
Only now and again a sadness fell upon me and I started up from my
dream and felt a sweet trace of a strange fragrance in the south wind
That vague sweetness made my heart ache with longing and it seemed to
me that is was the eager breath of the summer seeking for its completion
I knew not then that it was so near that it was mine and that this
perfect sweetness had blossomed in the depth of my own heart
Come to my garden walk my love Pass by the fervid flowers that
press themselves on your sight Pass them by stopping at some
chance joy which like a sudden wonder of sunset illumines yet
elude
For lovers gift is shy it never tells its name it flits
across the shade spreading a shiver of joy along the dust
Overtake it or miss it for ever But a gift that can be
grasped is merely a frail flower or a lamp with flame that will
flicker
She is near to my heart as the meadowflower to the earth she is
sweet to me as sleep is to tired limbs My love for her is my life
flowing in its fullness like a river in autumn flood running with
serene abandonment My songs are one with my love like the murmur
of a stream that sings with all its waves and current
Tired of waiting you burst your bonds impatient flowers before
the winter had gone Glimpses of the unseen comer reached your
wayside watch and you rushed out running and panting impulsive
jasmines troops of riotous roses
You were the first to march to the breach of death your
clamour of colour and perfume troubled the air You laughed and
pressed and pushed each other bared your breast and dropped in
heaps
The Summer will come in its time sailing in the floodtide
of the south wind But you never counted slow moments to be sure
of him You recklessly spent your all in the road in the terrible
joy of faith
You heard his footsteps from afar and flung your mantle of
death for him to tread upon Your bonds break even before the
rescuer is seen you make him your own ere he can come and claim
you
In the beginning of time there rose from the churning of Gods
dream two women One is the dancer at the court of paradise the
desired of men she who laughs and plucks the minds of the wise
from their cold meditations and of fools from their emptiness and
scatters them like seeds with careless hands in the extravagant
winds of March in the flowering frenzy of May
The other is the crowned queen of heaven the mother throned
on the fullness of golden autumn she who in the harvesttime
brings straying hearts to the smile sweet as tears the beauty deep
as the sea of silence brings them to the temple of the Unknown
at the holy confluence of Life and Death
The evening was lonely for me and I was reading a book till my
heart became dry and it seemed to me that beauty was a thing
fashioned by the traders in words Tired I shut the book and
snuffed the candle In a moment the room was flooded with
moonlight
Spirit of Beauty how could you whose radiance overbrims the
sky stand hidden behind a candles tiny flame How could a few
vain words from a book rise like a mist and veil her whose voice
has hushed the heart of earth into ineffable calm
Things throng and laugh loud in the sky the sands and dust dance
and whirl like children Mans mind is aroused by their shouts his
thoughts long to be the playmates of things
Our dreams drifting in the stream of the vague stretch their
arms to clutch the earth their efforts stiffen into bricks and
stones and thus the city of man is built
Voices come swarming from the pastseeking answers from the
living moments Beats of their wings fill the air with tremulous
shadows and sleepless thoughts in our minds leave their nests to
take flight across the desert of dimness in the passionate thirst
for forms They are lampless pilgrims seeking the shore of light
to find themselves in things They will be lured into poetss
rhymes they will be housed in the towers of the town not yet
planned they have their call to arms from the battle fields of the
future they are bidden to join hands in the strife of peace yet
to come
Take back your coins Kings Councillor I am of those women you
sent to the forest shrine to decoy the young ascetic who had never
seen a women I failed in your bidding
Dimly day was breaking when the hermit boy came to bathe in
the stream his tawny locks crowded on his shoulders like a
cluster of morning clouds and his limbs shining like a streak of
sunbeam We laughed and sang as we rowed in our boat we jumped
into the river in a mad frolic and danced around him when the sun
rose staring at us from the waters edge in a flush of divine
anger
Like a childgod the boy opened his eyes and watched our
movements the wonder deepening till his eyes shone like morning
stars He lifted his clasped hands and chanted a hymn of praise in
his birdlike young voice thrilling every leaf of the forest
Never such words were sung to a mortal woman before they were like
the silent hymn to the dawn which rises from the hushed hills THe
women hid their mouths with their hands their bodies swaying with
laughter and a spasm of doubt ran across his face Quickly came
I to his side sorely pained and bowing to his feet I said
Lord accept my service
I led him to the grassy bank wiped his body with the end of
my silken mantle and kneeling on the ground I dried his feet
with my trailing hair When I raised my face and looked into his
eyes I thought I felt the worlds first kiss to the first woman
Blessed am I blessed is God who made me a woman I heard him say
to me What God unknown are you YOur touch is the touch of the
Immortal your eyes have the mystery of the midnight
Ah no not that smile Kings Councillor the dust of
worldly wisdom has covered your sight old man But this boys
innocence pierced the mist and saw the shining truth the woman
divine
The women clapped their hands and laughed their obscene
laugh and with veils dragged on the dust and hair hanging loose
they began to pelt him with flowers
Alas my spotless sun could not my shame weave fiery mist to
cover you in its folds I fell at his feet and cried Forgive me
 I fled like a stricken deer through shade and sun and cried as
I fled  Forgive me  The womens foul laughter pressed me like
a cracking fire but the words ever rang in my ears  What God
unknown are you
I would ask for still more if I had the sky with all its stars
and the world with its endless riches but I would be content with
the smallest corner of this earth if only she were mine
There is room for you You are alone with your few sheaves of rice
My boat is crowded it is heavily laden but how can I turn you
away Your young body is slim and swaying there is a twinkling
smile in the edge of your eyes and your robe is coloured like the
rain cloud
The travellers will land for different roads and homes You
will sit for a while on the prow of my boat and at the journeys
end none will keep you back
Where do you go and to what home to garner your sheaves I
will not question you but when I fold my sails and moor my boat
I shall sit and wonder in the evening Where do you go and to
what home to garner your sheaves
Last night in the garden I offered you my youths foaming wine You
lifted the cup to your lips you shut your eyes and smiled while
I raised your veil unbound your tresses drawing down upon my
breast your face sweet with its silence last night when the moons
dream overflowed the world of slumber
Today in the dewcooled calm of the dawn you are walking to
Gods temple bathed and robed in white with a basketful of
flowers in your hand I stand aside in the shade under the tree
with my head bent in the calm of the dawn by the lonely road to
the temple
It is written in the book that Man when fifty must leave the
noisy world to go to the forest seclusion But the poet proclaims
that the forest hermitage is only for the young For it is the
birthplace of flowers and the haunt of birds and bees and hidden
hooks are waiting there for the thrill of lovers whispers There
the moonlight that is all one kiss for the malati flowers has
its deep message but those who understand it are far below fifty
And alas youth is inexperienced and wilful therefore it is
but meet that the old should take charge of the household and the
young take to the seclusion of forest shades and the severe
discipline of courting
A message came from my youth of vanished days saying  I wait for
you among the quivering of unborn May where smiles ripen for tears
and hours ache with songs unsung
It says Come to me across the wornout track of age through
the gates of death For dreams fade hopes fail the fathered
fruits of the year decay but I am the eternal truth and you shall
meet me again and again in your voyage of life from shore to
shore
Are you a mere picture and not as true as those stars true as
this dust They throb with the pulse of things but you are
immensely aloof in your stillness painted form
The day was when you walked with me your breath warm your
limbs singing of life My world found its speech in your voice and
touched my heart with your face You suddenly stopped in your walk
in the shadowside of the Forever and I went on alone
Life like a child laughs shaking its rattle of death as it
runs it beckons me on I follow the unseen but you stand there
where you stopped behind that dust and those stars and you are a
mere picture
No it cannot be Had the lifeflood utterly stopped in you
it would stop the river in its flow and the footfall of dawn in
her cadence of colours Had the glimmering dusk of your hair
vanished in the hopeless dark the woodland shade of summer would
die with its dreams
Can it be true that I forgot you We haste on without heed
forgetting the flowers on the roadside hedge Yet they breathe
unaware into our forgetfulness filling it with music You have
moved from my world to take seat at the root of my life and
therefore is this forgettingremembrance lost in its own depth
You are no longer before my songs but one with them You came
to me with the first ray of dawn I lost you with the last gold of
evening Ever since I am always finding you through the dark No
you are no mere picture
Dying you have left behind you the great sadness of the Eternal
in my life You have painted my thoughts horizon with the sunset
colours of your departure leaving a track of tears across the
earth to loves heaven Clasped in your dear arms life and death
united in me in a marriage bond
I think I can see you watching there in the balcony with your
lamp lighted where the end and the beginning of all things meet
My world went hence through the doors that you openedyou holding
the cup of death to my lips filling it with life from your own
Where is heaven you ask me my childthe sages tell us it is
beyond the limits of birth and death unswayed by the rhythm of day
and night it is not of the earth
But your poet knows that its eternal hunger is for time and
space and it strives evermore to be born in the fruitful dust
Heaven is fulfilled in your sweet body my child in your
palpitating heart
The sea is beating its drums in joy the flowers are atiptoe
to kiss you For heaven is born in you in the arms of the mother
dust
The road is my wedded companion She speaks to me under my feet all
day she sings to my dreams all night
My meeting with her had no beginning it begins endlessly at
each daybreak renewing its summer in fresh flowers and songs and
her every new kiss is the first kiss to me
The road and I are lovers I change my dress for her night
after night leaving the tattered cumber of the old in the wayside
inns when the day dawns
I travelled the old road every day I took my fruits to the market
my cattle to the meadows I ferried my boat across the stream and
all the ways were well known to me
One morning my basket was heavy with wares Men were busy in
the fields the pastures crowded with cattle the breast of earth
heaved with the mirth of ripening rice
Suddenly there was a tremor in the air and the sky seemed to
kiss me on my forehead My mind started up like the morning out of
mist
I forgot to follow the track I stepped a few paces from the
path and my familiar world appeared strange to me like a flower
I had only known in bud
My everyday wisdom was ashamed I went astray in the fairyland
of things It was the best luck of my life that I lost my path that
morning and found my eternal childhood
She dwelt here by the pool with its landingstairs in ruins Many
an evening she had watched the moon made dizzy by the shaking of
bamboo leaves and on many a rainy day the smell of the wet earth
had come to her over the young shoots of rice
Her pet name is known here among those datepalm groves and
in the courtyards where girls sit and talk while stitching their
winter quilts The water in this pool keeps in its depth the memory
of her swimming limbs and her wet feet had left their marks day
after day on the footpath leading to the village
The women who come today with their vessels to the water have
all seen her smile over simple jests and the old peasant taking
his bullocks to their bath used to stop at her door every day to
greet her
Many a sailingboat passes by this village many a traveller
takes rest beneath that banyan tree the ferryboat crosses to
yonder ford carrying crowds to the market but they never notice
this spot by the village road near the pool with its ruined
landingstairswhere dwelt she whom I love
Your days will be full of cares if you must give me your heart
My house by the crossroads has its doors open and my mind is
absent for I sing
I shall never be made to answer for it if you must give me
your heart If I pledge my word to you in tunes now and am too
much in earnest to keep it when music is silent you must forgive
me for the law laid down in May is best broken in December
Do not always keep remembering it if you must give me your
heart When your eyes sing with love and your voice ripples with
laughter my answers to your questions will be wild and not
miserly accurate in facts they are to be believed for ever and
then forgotten for good
I shall gladly suffer the pride of culture to die out in my house
if only in some happy future I am born a herdboy in the Brinda
forest
The herdboy who grazes his cattle sitting under the banyan
tree and idly weaves gunja flowers into garlands who loves to
splash and plunge in the Jamunas cool deep stream
He calls his companions to wake up when morning dawns and all
the houses in the lane hum with the sound of the churn clouds of
dust are raised by the cattle the maidens come out in the
courtyard to milk the king
As the shadows deepen under the tomal trees and the dusk
gathers on the riverbanks when the milkmaids while crossing the
turbulent water tremble with fear and loud peacocks with tails
outspread dance in the forest he watchers the summer clouds
When the April night is sweet as a freshblown flower he
disappears in the forest with a peacocks plume in his hair the
swing ropes are twined with flowers on the branches the south wind
throbs with music and the merry shepherd boys crowd on the banks
of the blue river
No I will never be the leader brothers of this new age of
new Bengal I shall not trouble to light the lamp of culture for
the benighted If only I could be born under the shady asoka
groves in some village of Brinda where milk is churned by the
maidens
I dreamt that she sat by my head tenderly ruffling my hair with
her fingers playing the melody of her touch I looked at her face
and struggled with my tears till the agony of unspoken words burst
my sleep like a bubble
I sat up and saw the glow of the Milky Way above my window
like a world of silence on fire and I wondered if at this moment
she had a dream that rhymed with mine
There is a lookeron who sits behind my eyes I seems he has seen
things in ages and worlds beyond memorys shore and those
forgotten sights glisten on the grass and shiver on the leaves He
has seen under new veils the face of the one beloved in twilight
hours of many a nameless star Therefore his sky seems to ache with
the pain of countless meetings and partings and a longing pervades
this spring breeze the longing that is full of the whisper of
ages without beginning
Why do you speak so softly Death Death
Creep upon me watch me so stealthily
This is not how a lover should behave
When evening flowers droop upon their tired
Stems when cattle are brought in from the fields
After a whole day’s grazing you Death
Death approach me with such gentle steps
Settle yourself immovably by my side
I cannot understand the things you say
Alas will this be how you will take me Death
Death Like a thief laying heavy sleep
On my eyes as you descend to my heart
Will you thus let your tread be a slow beat
In my sleepnumbed blood your jingling anklebells
A drowsy rumble in my ear Will you Death
Death wrap me finally in your cold
Arms and carry me away while I dream
I do not know why you thus come and go
Tell me is this the way you wed Death
Death Unceremonially with no
Weight of sacrament or blessing or prayer
Will you come with your massy tawny hair
Unkempt unbound into a bright coilcrown
Will no one bear your victoryflag before
Or after will no torches glow like red
Eyes along the river Death Death
Will earth not quake in terror at your step
When fierceeyed Siva came to take his bride
Remember all the pomp and trappings Death
Death the flapping tigerskins he wore
His roaring bull the serpents hissing round
His hair the bombom sound as he slapped his cheeks
The necklace of skulls swinging round his neck
The sudden raucous music as he blew
His horn to announce his coming was this not
A better way of wedding Death Death
And as that deathly weddingparty’s din
Grew nearer Death Death tears of joy
Filled Gauri’s eyes and the garments at her breast
Quivered her left eye fluttered and her heart
Pounded her body quailed with thrilled delight
And her mind ran away with itself Death Death
Her mother wailed and smote her head at the thought
Of receiving so wild a groom and in his mind
Her father agreed calamity had struck
Why must you always come like a thief Death
Death always silently at night’s end
Leaving only tears Come to me festively
Make the whole night ring with your triumph blow
Your victoryconch dress me in bloodred robes
Grasp me by the hand and sweep me away
Pay no heed to what others may think Death
Death for I shall of my own free will
Resort to you if you but take me gloriously
If I am immersed in work in my room
When you arrive Death Death then break
My work thrust my unreadiness aside
If I am sleeping sinking all desires
In the dreamy pleasure of my bed or I lie
With apathy gripping my heart and my eyes
Flickering between sleep and waking fill
Your conch with your destructive breath and blow
Death Death and I shall run to you
I shall go to where your boat is moored
Death Death to the sea where the wind rolls
Darkness towards me from infinity
I may see black clouds massing in the far
Northeast corner of the sky fiery snakes
Of lightning may rear up with their hoods raised
But I shall not flinch in unfounded fear
I shall pass silently unswervingly
Across that red stormsea Death Death
That I should make much of myself and turn it on all sides
thus casting colored shadows on thy radiance
such is thy Maya
Thou settest a barrier in thine own being
and then callest thy severed self in myriad notes
This thy selfseparation has taken body in me
The poignant song is echoed through all the sky in manycoloued tears
and smiles alarms and hopes waves rise up and sink again
dreams break and form
In me is thy own defeat of self
This screen that thou hast raised is painted with innumerable figures
with the brush of the night and the day
Behind it thy seat is woven in wondrous mysteries of curves
casting away all barren lines of straightness
The great pageant of thee and me has overspread the sky
With the tune of thee and me all the air is vibrant
and all ages pass with the hiding and seeking of thee and me

I ask for a moments indulgence to sit by thy side The works
that I have in hand I will finish afterwards
Away from the sight of thy face my heart knows no rest nor respite
and my work becomes an endless toil in a shoreless sea of toil
Today the summer has come at my window with its sighs and murmurs and
the bees are plying their minstrelsy at the court of the flowering grove
Now it is time to sit quite face to face with thee and to sing
dedication of life in this silent and overflowing leisure

I like to be dependent and so for ever
with warmth and care of my mother
my father to love kiss and embrace
wear life happily in all their grace
I like to be dependent and so for ever
on my kith and kin for they all shower
harsh and warm advices complaints
full wondering true and info giants
I like to be dependent and so for ever
for my friends chat and want me near
with domesticfamily and romantic tips
colleagues as well guide me work at risks
I like to be dependent and so for ever
for my neighbours too envy at times
when at my rise of fortune like to hear
my daily steps easy and odd things too
Art thou abroad on this stormy night
on thy journey of love my friend
The sky groans like one in despair
I have no sleep tonight
Ever and again I open my door and look out on
the darkness my friend
I can see nothing before me
I wonder where lies thy path
By what dim shore of the inkblack river
by what far edge of the frowning forest
through what mazy depth of gloom art thou threading
thy course to come to me my friend
I have made You the polar star of my
existence never again can I lose my way in the
voyage of life
Wherever I go You are always there to
shower your benefience all around me Your face
is ever present before my minds eyes
If I lose sight of You even for a moment I
almost lose my mind
Whenever my heart is about to go astray just
a glance of You makes it feel ashamed of itself
This song of mine will wind its music around you my child like
the fond arms of love
This song of mine will touch your forehead like a kiss of
blessing
When you are alone it will sit by your side and whisper in
your ear when you are in the crowd it will fence you about with
aloofness
My song will be like a pair of wings to your dreams it will
transport your heart to the verge of the unknown
It will be like the faithful star overhead when dark night is
over your road
My song will sit in the pupils of your eyes and will carry
your sight into the heart of things
And when my voice is silent in death my song will speak in
your living heart
O Fool try to carry thyself upon thy own shoulders
O beggar to come beg at thy own door
Leave all thy burdens on his hands who can bear all
and never look behind in regret
Thy desire at once puts out the light from the lamp it touches with its breath
It is unholytake not thy gifts through its unclean hands
Accept only what is offered by sacred love
I dive down into the depth of the ocean of forms
hoping to gain the perfect pearl of the formless
No more sailing from harbor to harbor with this my weatherbeaten boat
The days are long passed when my sport was to be tossed on waves
And now I am eager to die into the deathless
Into the audience hall by the fathomless abyss
where swells up the music of toneless strings
I shall take this harp of my life
I shall tune it to the notes of forever
and when it has sobbed out its last utterance
lay down my silent harp at the feet of the silent

Thou hast made me known to friends whom I knew not
Thou hast given me seats in homes not my own
Thou hast brought the distant near and made a brother of the stranger
I am uneasy at heart when I have to leave my accustomed shelter
I forget that there abides the old in the new
and that there also thou abidest
Through birth and death in this world or in others
wherever thou leadest me it is thou the same
the one companion of my endless life
who ever linkest my heart with bonds of joy to the unfamiliar
When one knows thee then alien there is none then no door is shut
Oh grant me my prayer that I may never lose
the bliss of the touch of the one
in the play of many

The night is black and the forest has no end
a million people thread it in a million ways
We have trysts to keep in the darkness but where
or with whom of that we are unaware
But we have this faith that a lifetimes bliss
will appear any minute with a smile upon its lips
Scents touches sounds snatches of songs
brush us pass us give us delightful shocks
Then peradventure theres a flash of lightning
whomever I see that instant I fall in love with
I call that person and cry This life is blest
for your sake such miles have I traversed
All those others who came close and moved off
in the darkness I dont know if they exist or not
On the seashore of endless worlds children meet
The infinite sky is motionless overhead and the restless water is boisterous On the seashore of endless worlds the children meet with shouts and dances
They build their houses with sand and they play with empty shells With withered leaves they weave their boats and smilingly float them on the vast deep Children have their play on the seashore of worlds
They know not how to swim they know not how to cast nets Pearlfishers dive for pearls merchants sail in their ships while children gather pebbles and scatter them again They seek not for hidden treasures they know not how to cast nets
The sea surges up with laughter and pale gleams the smile of the seabeach Deathdealing waves sing meaningless ballads to the children even like a mother while rocking her babys cradle The sea plays with children and pale gleams the smile of the seabeach
On the seashore of endless worlds children meet Tempest roams in the pathless sky ships are wrecked in the trackless water death is abroad and children play On the seashore of endless worlds is the great meeting of children
One day in spring a woman came
In my lonely woods
In the lovely form of the Beloved
Came to give to my songs melodies
To give to my dreams sweetness
Suddenly a wild wave
Broke over my hearts shores
And drowned all language
To my lips no name came
She stood beneath the tree turned
Glanced at my face made sad with pain
And with quick steps came and sat by me
Taking my hands in hers she said
You do not know me nor I you
I wonder how this could be
I said
We two shall build a bridge for ever
Between two beings each to the other unknown
This eager wonder is at the heart of things
The cry that is in my heart is also the cry of her heart
The thread with which she binds me binds her too
Her have I sought everywhere
Her have I worshipped within me
Hidden in that worship she has sought me too
Crossing the wide oceans she came to steal my heart
She forgot to return having lost her own
Her own charms play traitor to her
She spreads her net knowing not
Whether she will catch or be caught
That I want thee only theelet my heart repeat without end
All desires that distract me day and night
are false and empty to the core
As the night keeps hidden in its gloom the petition for light
even thus in the depth of my unconsciousness rings the cry
I want thee only thee
As the storm still seeks its end in peace
when it strikes against peace with all its might
even thus my rebellion strikes against thy love
and still its cry is
I want thee only thee

Palmtree singlelegged giant
topping other trees
peering at the firmament
It longs to pierce the black cloudceiling
and fly away away
if only it had wings
The tree seems to express its wish
in the tossing of its head
its fronds heave and swish
It thinks Maybe my leaves are feathers
and nothing stops me now
from rising on their flutter
All day the fronds the windblown tree
soar and flap and shudder
as though it thinks it can fly
As though it wanders in the skies
travelling who knows where
wheeling past the stars
And then as soon as the wind dies down
the fronds subside subside
the mind of the tree returns
To earth recalls that earth is its mother
and then it likes once more
its earthly corner
Day by day I float my paper boats one by one down the running
stream
In bid black letters I write my name on them and the name of
the village where I live
I hope that someone in some strange land will find them and
know who I am
I load my little boats with shiuli flower from our garden and
hope that these blooms of the dawn will be carried safely to land
in the night
I launch my paper boats and look up into the sky and see the
little clouds setting thee white bulging sails
I know not what playmate of mine in the sky sends them down
the air to race with my boats
When night comes I bury my face in my arms and dream that my
paper boats float on and on under the midnight stars
The fairies of sleep are sailing in them and the lading ins
their baskets full of dreams
When I go from hence
let this be my parting word
that what I have seen is unsurpassable
I have tasted of the hidden honey of this lotus
that expands on the ocean of light
and thus am I blessed
let this be my parting word
In this playhouse of infinite forms
I have had my play
and here have I caught sight of him that is formless
My whole body and my limbs
have thrilled with his touch who is beyond touch
and if the end comes here let it come
let this be my parting word

Yes I know this is nothing but thy love
O beloved of my heartthis golden light that dances upon the leaves
these idle clouds sailing across the sky
this passing breeze leaving its coolness upon my forehead
The morning light has flooded my eyesthis is thy message to my heart
Thy face is bent from above thy eyes look down on my eyes
and my heart has touched thy feet

If thou speakest not I will fill my heart with thy silence and endure it
I will keep still and wait like the night with starry vigil
and its head bent low with patience
The morning will surely come the darkness will vanish
and thy voice pour down in golden streams breaking through the sky
Then thy words will take wing in songs from every one of my birds nests
and thy melodies will break forth in flowers in all my forest groves
Child how happy you are sitting in the dust playing with a broken twig all the morning
I smile at your play with that little bit of a broken twig
I am busy with my accounts adding up figures by the hour
Perhaps you glance at me and think What a stupid game to spoil your morning with
Child I have forgotten the art of being absorbed in sticks and mudpies
I seek out costly playthings and gather lumps of gold and silver
With whatever you find you create your glad games I spend both my time and my strength over things I never can obtain
In my frail canoe I struggle to cross the sea of desire and forget that I too am playing a game
Beauty is truths smile
when she beholds her own face in a perfect mirror
Beauty is in the ideal of perfect harmony
which is in the universal being
truth the perfect comprehension of the universal mind
Life is given to us
we earn it by giving it
Let the dead have the immortality of fame
but the living the immortality of love
Lifes errors cry for the merciful beauty
that can modulate their isolation into a
harmony with the whole
Life like a child laughs
shaking its rattle of death as it runs
Love adorns itself
it seeks to prove inward joy by outward beauty
Love does not claim possession
but gives freedom
Love is an endless mystery
for it has nothing else to explain it
Loves gift cannot be given
it waits to be accepted
Man goes into the noisy crowd
to drown his own clamour of silence
Man is immortal therefore he must die endlessly
For life is a creative idea
it can only find itself in changing forms
Mans abiding happiness is not in getting anything
but in giving himself up to what is greater than himself
to ideas which are larger than his individual life
the idea of his country
of humanity
of God
The butterfly counts not months but moments
and has time enough

Time is a wealth of change
but the clock in its parody makes it mere change and no wealth
Let your life lightly dance on the edges of Time
like dew on the tip of a leaf
Prisoner tell me who was it that bound you
It was my master said the prisoner
I thought I could outdo everybody in the world in wealth and power
and I amassed in my own treasurehouse the money due to my king
When sleep overcame me I lay upon the bed that was for my lord
and on waking up I found I was a prisoner in my own treasurehouse
Prisoner tell me who was it that wrought this unbreakable chain
It was I said the prisoner who forged this chain very carefully
I thought my invincible power would hold the world captive
leaving me in a freedom undisturbed
Thus night and day I worked at the chain
with huge fires and cruel hard strokes
When at last the work was done
and the links were complete and unbreakable
I found that it held me in its grip

Life of my life I shall ever try to keep my body pure knowing
that thy living touch is upon all my limbs
I shall ever try to keep all untruths out from my thoughts knowing
that thou art that truth which has kindled the light of reason in my mind
I shall ever try to drive all evils away from my heart and keep my
love in flower knowing that thou hast thy seat in the inmost shrine of my heart
And it shall be my endeavour to reveal thee in my actions knowing it
is thy power gives me strength to act
I am like a remnant of a cloud of autumn
uselessly roaming in the sky O my sun everglorious
Thy touch has not yet melted my vapor
making me one with thy light
and thus I count months and years separated from thee
If this be thy wish and if this be thy play
then take this fleeting emptiness of mine
paint it with colors gild it with gold
float it on the wanton wind and spread it in varied wonders
And again when it shall be thy wish to end this play at night
I shall melt and vanish away in the dark
or it may be in a smile of the white morning
in a coolness of purity transparent
Early in the day it was whispered that we should sail in a boat
only thou and I and never a soul in the world would know of this our
pilgrimage to no country and to no end
In that shoreless ocean
at thy silently listening smile my songs would swell in melodies
free as waves free from all bondage of words
Is the time not come yet
Are there works still to do
Lo the evening has come down upon the shore
and in the fading light the seabirds come flying to their nests
Who knows when the chains will be off
and the boat like the last glimmer of sunset
vanish into the night

In one salutation to thee my God
let all my senses spread out and touch this world at thy feet
Like a raincloud of July
hung low with its burden of unshed showers
let all my mind bend down at thy door in one salutation to thee
Let all my songs gather together their diverse strains into a single current
and flow to a sea of silence in one salutation to thee
Like a flock of homesick cranes flying night and day
back to their mountain nests
let all my life take its voyage to its eternal home
in one salutation to thee

On the seashore of endless worlds children meet
The infinite sky is motionless overhead
and the restless water is boisterous
On the seashore of endless worlds
the children meet with shouts and dances
They build their houses with sand
and they play with empty shells
With withered leaves they weave their boats
and smilingly float them on the vast deep
Children have their play on the seashore of worlds
They know not how to swim they know not how to cast nets
Pearl fishers dive for pearls merchants sail in their ships
while children gather pebbles and scatter them again
They seek not for hidden treasures they know not how to cast nets
The sea surges up with laughter
and pale gleams the smile of the sea beach
Deathdealing waves sing meaningless ballads to the children
even like a mother while rocking her babys cradle
The sea plays with children
and pale gleams the smile of the sea beach
On the seashore of endless worlds children meet
Tempest roams in the pathless sky
ships get wrecked in the trackless water
death is abroad and children play
On the seashore of endless worlds is the
great meeting of children
Deliverance is not for me in renunciation
I feel the embrace of freedom in a thousand bonds of delight
Thou ever pourest for me the fresh draught of thy wine of various
colours and fragrance filling this earthen vessel to the brim
My world will light its hundred different lamps with thy flame
and place them before the altar of thy temple
No I will never shut the doors of my senses
The delights of sight and hearing and touch will bear thy delight
Yes all my illusions will burn into illumination of joy
and all my desires ripen into fruits of love

She who ever had remained in the depth of my being
in the twilight of gleams and of glimpses
she who never opened her veils in the morning light
will be my last gift to thee my God folded in my final song
Words have wooed yet failed to win her
persuasion has stretched to her its eager arms in vain
I have roamed from country to country keeping her in the core of my heart
and around her have risen and fallen the growth and decay of my life
Over my thoughts and actions my slumbers and dreams
she reigned yet dwelled alone and apart
Many a man knocked at my door and asked for her
and turned away in despair
There was none in the world who ever saw her face to face
and she remained in her loneliness waiting for thy recognition

The day was when I did not keep myself in readiness for thee
and entering my heart unbidden even as one of the common crowd
unknown to me my king thou didst press the signet of eternity upon
many a fleeting moment of my life
And today when by chance I light upon them and see thy signature
I find they have lain scattered in the dust mixed with the memory of
joys and sorrows of my trivial days forgotten
Thou didst not turn in contempt from my childish play among dust
and the steps that I heard in my playroom
are the same that are echoing from star to star

Have you not heard his silent steps
He comes comes ever comes
Every moment and every age
every day and every night he comes comes ever comes
Many a song have I sung in many a mood of mind
but all their notes have always proclaimed
He comes comes ever comes
In the fragrant days of sunny April through the forest path he comes
comes ever comes
In the rainy gloom of July nights on the thundering chariot of clouds
he comes comes ever comes
In sorrow after sorrow it is his steps that press upon my heart
and it is the golden touch of his feet that makes my joy to shine

I boasted among men that I had known you
They see your pictures in all works of mine
They come and ask me Who is he
I know not how to answer them I say Indeed I cannot tell
They blame me and they go away in scorn
And you sit there smiling
I put my tales of you into lasting songs
The secret gushes out from my heart
They come and ask me Tell me all your meanings
I know not how to answer them
I say Ah who knows what they mean
They smile and go away in utter scorn
And you sit there smiling

In the night of weariness
let me give myself up to sleep without struggle
resting my trust upon thee
Let me not force my flagging spirit into a poor preparation for thy worship
It is thou who drawest the veil of night upon the tired eyes of the day
to renew its sight in a fresher gladness of awakening
Who stole sleep from babys eyes I must know
Clasping her pitcher to her waist mother went to fetch water
from the village near by
It was noon The childrens playtime was over the ducks in
the pond were silent
The shepherd boy lay asleep under the shadow of the banyan
tree
The crane stood grave and still in the swamp near the mango
grove
In the meanwhile the Sleepstealer came and snatching sleep
from babys eyes flew away
When mother came back she found baby travelling the room over
on all fours
Who stole sleep from our babys eyes I must know I must find
her and chain her up
I must look into that dark cave where through boulders and
scowling stones trickles a tiny stream
I must search in the drowsy shade of the bakula grove where
pigeons coo in their corner and fairies anklets tinkle in the
stillness of starry nights
In the evening I will peep into the whispering silence of the
bamboo forest where fireflies squander their light and will ask
every creature I meet Can anybody tell me where the Sleepstealer
lives
Who stole sleep from babys eyes I must know
Shouldnt I give her a good lesson if I could only catch her
I would raid her nest and see where she hoards all her stolen
sleep
I would plunder it all and carry it home
I would bind her two wings securely set her on the bank of
the river and then let her play at fishing with a reed among the
rushes and waterlilies
When the marketing is over in the evening and the village
children sit in their mothers laps then the night birds will
mockingly din her ears with
Whose sleep will you steal now
The song that I came to sing remains unsung to this day
I have spent my days in stringing and in unstringing my instrument
The time has not come true the words have not been rightly set
only there is the agony of wishing in my heart
The blossom has not opened only the wind is sighing by
I have not seen his face nor have I listened to his voice
only I have heard his gentle footsteps from the road before my house
The livelong day has passed in spreading his seat on the floor
but the lamp has not been lit and I cannot ask him into my house
I live in the hope of meeting with him but this meeting is not yet
When I give up the helm
I know that the time has come for thee to take it
What there is to do will be instantly done
Vain is this struggle
Then take away your hands
and silently put up with your defeat my heart
and think it your good fortune to sit perfectly still
where you are placed
These my lamps are blown out at every little puff of wind
and trying to light them I forget all else again and again
But I shall be wise this time and wait in the dark
spreading my mat on the floor
and whenever it is thy pleasure my lord
come silently and take thy seat here
STRAY birds of summer come to my window
to sing and fly away
And yellow leaves of autumn
which have no songs
flutter and fall there with a sigh
O TROUPE of little vagrants of the world
leave your footprints in my words
THE world puts off its mask of vastness to its lover
It becomes small as one song
as one kiss of the eternal
IT is the tears of the earth
that keep her smiles in bloom
THE mighty desert is burning
for the love of a blade of grass
who shakes her head and laughs
and flies
away
IF you shed tears when you miss the sun
you also miss the stars
THE sands in your way beg for your song
and your movement
dancing water
Will you carry the burden of their lameness
HER wistful face haunts my dreams
like the rain at night
ONCE we dreamt that we were strangers
We wake up to find that we were dear to each other
SORROW is hushed into peace in my heart
like the evening among the silent trees
SOME unseen fingers like idle breeze
are playing upon my heart the music of the ripples
WHAT language is thine O sea
The language of eternal question
What language is thy answer O sky
The language of eternal silence
LISTEN
my heart
to the whispers of the world
with which it makes love to you
THE mystery of creation
is like the darkness of night
it is great
Delusions of knowledge are like
the fog of the morning
DO not seat your love upon a precipice because it is high
I SIT at my window this morning
where the world like a passerby stops for a moment
nods to me and goes
THESE little thoughts are the rustle of leaves
they have their whisper of
joy in my mind
WHAT you are you do not see
what you see is your shadow
MY wishes are fools they shout across thy songs my Master
Let me but listen
I CANNOT choose the best
The best chooses me
THEY throw their shadows before them
who carry their lantern on their back
THAT I exist
is a perpetual surprise
which is life
WE the rustling leaves
have a voice that answers the storms
but who are you so silent
I am a mere flower
REST belongs to the work
as the eyelids to the eyes
MAN is a born child
his power is the power of growth
GOD expects answers for the flowers he sends us
not for the sun
and the earth
THE light that plays like a naked child
among the green leaves happily knows not
that man can lie
O BEAUTY
find thyself in love
not in the flattery of thy mirror
MY heart beats her waves at the shore of the world
and writes upon it her signature in tears with the words
I love thee

MOON
for what do you wait
To salute the sun for whom I must make way
THE trees come up to my window
like the yearning voice of the dumb earth
HIS own mornings are new surprises to God
LIFE finds its wealth by the claims of the world
and its worth by the claims of love
THE dry riverbed finds no thanks for its past
THE bird wishes it were a cloud
The cloud wishes it were a bird
THE waterfall sings
I find my song
when I find my freedom
I CANNOT tell why this heart languishes in silence
It is for small needs it never asks
or knows or remembers
WOMAN
when you move about in your household service
your limbs sing like a hill stream among its pebbles
THE sun goes to cross the Western sea
leaving its last salutation to the East
DO not blame your food because you have no appetite
THE trees
like the longings of the earth
stand atiptoe to peep at the heaven
YOU smiled and talked to me of nothing
and I felt that for this I had been waiting long
THE fish in the water is silent
the animal on the earth is noisy
the bird in the air is singing
But Man has in him
the silence of the sea
the noise of the earth
and the music of the air
THE world rushes on
over the strings of the lingering heart
making the music of sadness
HE has made his weapons his gods
When his weapons win he is defeated himself
GOD finds himself by creating
SHADOW
with her veil drawn
follows Light in secret meekness
with her silent steps of
love
THE stars
are not afraid to appear like fireflies
I THANK thee that I am none of the wheels of power
but I am one with the living creatures
that are crushed by it
THE mind
sharp but not broad
sticks at every point
but does not move
YOUR idol is shattered in the dust
to prove that Gods dust is greater than
your idol
MAN does not reveal himself in his history
he struggles up through it
WHILE the glass lamp rebukes the earthen for calling it cousin
the moon rises and the glass lamp
with a bland smile calls her
My dear dear sister
LIKE the meeting of the seagulls
and the waves we meet and come near
The seagulls fly off
the waves roll away and we depart
MY day is done
and I am like a boat drawn on the beach
listening to the dancemusic of t
he tide in the evening
LIFE is given to us
we earn it by giving it
WE come nearest to the great
when we are great in humility
THE sparrow is sorry for the peacock
at the burden of its tail
NEVER be afraid of the moments
thus sings the voice of the everlasting
THE hurricane seeks the shortest road
by the noroad
and suddenly ends its search in the Nowhere
TAKE my wine in my own cup friend
It loses its wreath of foam
when poured into that of others
THE Perfect decks itself in beauty
for the love of the Imperfect
GOD says to man
I heal you therefore I hurt
love you therefore punish
THANK the flame for its light
but do not forget the lampholder
standing in the shade with constancy of patience
TINY grass
your steps are small
but you possess the earth under your tread
THE infant flower opens its bud and cries
Dear World please do not fade
GOD grows weary of great kingdoms
but never of little flowers
WRONG cannot afford defeat
but Right can
I GIVE my whole water in joy
 sings the waterfall
though little of it is enough for the thirsty
WHERE is the fountain
that throws up these flowers
in a ceaseless outbreak of ecstasy
THE woodcutters axe begged for its handle from the tree
The tree gave it
IN my solitude of heart
I feel the sigh of this widowed evening
veiled with mist and rain
CHASTITY
is a wealth that comes from
abundance of love
THE mist
like love
plays upon the heart of the hills
and brings out surprises of beauty
WE read the world wrong
and say that it deceives us
THE poet wind is out over the sea
and the forest to seek his own voice
EVERY child
comes with the message
that God is not yet discouraged
of man
THE grass seeks her crowd in the earth
The tree seeks his solitude of the sky
MAN barricades against himself
YOUR voice my friend
wanders in my heart
like the muffled sound of the sea
among these listening pines
WHAT is this unseen flame of darkness
whose sparks are the stars
LET life be beautiful like summer flowers
and death like autumn leaves
HE who wants to do good knocks at the gate
he who loves
finds the gate open
IN death the many becomes one
in life the one becomes many
Religion will be one
when God is dead
THE artist is the lover of Nature
therefore he is her slave
and her master
HOW far are you from me O Fruit
I am hidden in your heart O Flower
THIS longing is for the one who is felt in the dark
but not seen in the day
YOU are the big drop of dew under the lotus leaf
I am the smaller one on its upper side
 said the dewdrop to the lake
THE scabbard is content to be dull
when it protects the keenness of the sword
IN darkness
the One appears as uniform
in the light
the One appears as manifold
WHAT is this unseen flame of darkness
whose sparks are the stars
LET life be beautiful like summer flowers
and death like autumn leaves
HE who wants to do good knocks at the gate
he who loves
finds the gate open
IN death the many becomes one
in life the one becomes many
Religion will be one
when God is dead
THE artist is the lover of Nature
therefore he is her slave
and her master
HOW far are you from me O Fruit
I am hidden in your heart O Flower
THIS longing is for the one who is felt in the dark
but not seen in the day
YOU are the big drop of dew under the lotus leaf
I am the smaller one on its upper side
 said the dewdrop to the lake
THE scabbard is content to be dull
when it protects the keenness of the sword
IN darkness
the One appears as uniform
in the light
the One appears as manifold
THE great earth makes herself hospitable
with the help of the grass
THE birth and death of the leaves
are the rapid whirls of the eddy
whose wider circles
move slowly among stars
POWER said to the world You are mine
The world kept it prisoner on her throne
Love said to the world I am thine
The world gave it the freedom of her house
THE mist is like the earths desire
It hides the sun for whom she cries
BE still
my heart
these great trees are prayers
THE noise of the moment
scoffs at the music of the Eternal
I THINK of other ages
that floated upon the stream of life
and love and death and are forgotten
and I feel the freedom of passing away
THE sadness of my soul is her brides veil
It waits to be lifted in the night
DEATHS stamp gives value to the coin of life
making it possible to buy with life what is truly precious
The same stream of life that runs through my veins night and day
runs through the world and dances in rhythmic measures
It is the same life that shoots in joy through the dust of the earth
in numberless blades of grass
and breaks into tumultuous waves of leaves and flowers
It is the same life that is rocked in the oceancradle of birth
and of death in ebb and in flow
I feel my limbs are made glorious by the touch of this world of life
And my pride is from the lifethrob of ages dancing in my blood this moment

My desires are many and my cry is pitiful
but ever didst thou save me by hard refusals
and this strong mercy has been wrought into my life through and through
Day by day thou art making me worthy of the simple
great gifts that thou gavest to me unaskedthis sky and the light this body and the
life and the mindsaving me from perils of overmuch desire
There are times when I languidly linger
and times when I awaken and hurry in search of my goal
but cruelly thou hidest thyself from before me
Day by day thou art making me worthy of thy full acceptance by
refusing me ever and anon saving me from perils of weak uncertain desire
Mother your baby is silly She is so absurdly childish
She does not know the difference between the lights in the
streets and the stars
When we play at eating with pebbles she thinks they are real
food and tries to put them into her mouth
When I open a book before her and ask her to learn her a b
c she tears the leaves with her hands and roars for joy at
nothing this is your babys way of doing her lesson
When I shake my head at her in anger and scold her and call
her naughty she laughs and thinks it great fun
Everybody knows that father is away but if in play I call
aloud Father she looks about her in excitement and thinks that
father is near
When I hold my class with the donkeys that our washer man
brings to carry away the clothes and I warn her that I am the
schoolmaster she will scream for no reason and call me dada
Your baby wants to catch the moon She is so funny she calls
Ganesh Ganush
Mother your baby is silly She is so absurdly childish
If I were only a little puppy not your baby mother dear would
you say No to me if I tried to eat from your dish
Would you drive me off saying to me Get away you naughty
little puppy
Then go mother go I will never come to you when you call
me and never let you feed me any more
If I were only a little green parrot and not your baby
mother dear would you keep me chained lest I should fly away
Would you shake your finger at me and say What an ungrateful
wretch of a bird It is gnawing at its chain day and night
The go mother go I will run away into the woods I will
never let you take me in your arms again
I only said When in the evening the round full moon gets
entangled among the beaches of that Dadam tree couldnt somebody
catch it
But dada laughed at me and said Baby you are the silliest
child I have ever known The moon is ever so far from us how could
anybody catch it
I said Dada how foolish you are When mother looks out of
her window and smiles down at us playing would you call her far
away
Still dada said You are a stupid child But baby where
could you find a net big enough to catch the moon with
I said Surely you could catch it with your hands
But dada laughed and said You are the silliest child I have
known If it came nearer you would see how big the moon is
I said Dada what nonsense they teach at your school When
mother bends her face down to kiss us does her face look very
big
But still dada says You are a stupid child
O you shaggyheaded banyan tree standing on the bank of the pond
have you forgotten the little chile like the birds that have
nested in your branches and left you
Do you not remember how he sat at the window and wondered at
the tangle of your roots and plunged underground
The women would come to fill their jars in the pond and your
huge black shadow would wriggle on the water like sleep struggling
to wake up
Sunlight danced on the ripples like restless tiny shuttles
weaving golden tapestry
Two ducks swam by the weedy margin above their shadows and
the child would sit still and think
He longed to be the wind and blow through your resting
branches to be your shadow and lengthen with the day on the water
to be a bird and perch on your topmost twig and to float like
those ducks among the weeds and shadows
Where have I come from where did you pick me up the baby asked
its mother
She answered half crying half laughing and clasping the
baby to her breast
You were hidden in my heart as its desire my darling
You were in the dolls of my childhoods games and when with
clay I made the image of my god every morning I made the unmade
you then
You were enshrined with our household deity in his worship
I worshipped you
In all my hopes and my loves in my life in the life of my
mother you have lived
In the lap of the deathless Spirit who rules our home you have
been nursed for ages
When in girlhood my heart was opening its petals you hovered
as a fragrance about it
Your tender softness bloomed in my youthful limbs like a glow
in the sky before the sunrise
Heavens first darling twainborn with the morning light you
have floated down the stream of the worlds life and at last you
have stranded on my heart
As I gaze on your face mystery overwhelms me you who belong
to all have become mine
For fear of losing you I hold you tight to my breast What
magic has snared the worlds treasure in these slender arms of
mine
I must launch out my boat
The languid hours pass by on the
shoreAlas for me
The spring has done its flowering and taken leave
And now with the burden of faded futile flowers I wait and linger
The waves have become clamorous and upon the bank in the shady lane
the yellow leaves flutter and fall
What emptiness do you gaze upon
Do you not feel a thrill passing through the air
with the notes of the faraway song
floating from the other shore
Supposing I became a chanpa flower just for fun and grew on a
branch high up that tree and shook in the wind with laughter and
danced upon the newly budded leaves would you know me mother
You would call Baby where are you and I should laugh to
myself and keep quite quiet
I should slyly open my petals and watch you at your work
When after your bath with wet hair spread on your shoulders
you walked through the shadow of the champ tree to the little court
where you say your prayers you would notice the scent of the
flower but not know that it cane from me
When after the midday meal you sat at the window reading
ramayana and the trees shadow fell over your hair and your lap
I should fling my wee little shadow on to the page of your book
just where you were reading
But would you guess that it was the tiny shadow of your
little child
When in the evening you went to the cow shed with the lighted
lamp in your hand I should suddenly drop on to the earth again and
be your own baby once more and beg you to tell me a story
Where have you been you naughty child
I wont tell you mother Thats what you and I would say
then
They clamour and fight they doubt and despair they know no end
to their wrangling
Let your life come amongst them like a flame of light my
child unflickering and pure and delight them into silence
They are cruel in their greed and their envy their words are like
hidden knives thirsting for blood
Go and stand amidst their scowling hearts my child and let
your gentle eyes fall upon them like the forgiving peace of the
evening over the strife of the day
Let them see your face my child and thus know the meaning
of all things let them love you and thus love each other
Come and take your seat in the bosom of the limitless my
child At sunrise open and raise your heart like a blossoming
flower and at sunset bend your head and in silence complete the
worship of the day
It is time for me to go mother I am going
When in the paling darkness of the lonely dawn you stretch out
your arms for your baby in the bed I shall say Baby is not
heremother I am going
I shall become a delicate draught of air and caress you and
I shall be ripples in the water when you bathe and kiss you and
kiss you again
In the gusty night when the rain patters on the leaves you
will hear my whisper in your bed and my laughter will flash with
the lightning through the open window into your room
If you lie awake thinking of your baby till late into the
night I shall sing to you from the stars Sleep mother sleep
One the straying moonbeams I shall steal over your bed and
lie upon your bosom while you sleep
I shall become a dream and through the little opening of your
eyelids I shall slip into the depths of your sleep and when you
wake up and look round startled like a twinkling firefly I shall
flit out into the darkness
When on the great festival of puja the neighbours children
come and play about the house I shall melt into the music of the
flute and throb in your heart all day
Dear auntie will come with pujapresents and will askWhere
is our baby sister Mother you will tell her softly He is in
the pupils of my eyes he is in my body and in my soul
Ah these jasmines these white jasmines
I seem to remember the first day when I filled my hands with
these jasmines these white jasmines
I have loved the sunlight the sky and the green earth
I have heard the liquid murmur of the river thorough the
darkness of midnight
Autumn sunsets have come to me at the bend of a road in the
lonely waste like a bride raising her veil to accept her lover
Yet my memory is still sweet with the first white jasmines
that I held in my hands when I was a child
Many a glad day has come in my life and I have laughed with
merrymakers on festival nights
On grey mornings of rain I have crooned many an idle song
I have worn round my neck the evening wreath of bakulas woven
by the hand of love
Yet my heart is sweet with the memory of the first fresh
jasmines that filled my hands when I was a child
When stormclouds rumble in the sky and June showers come down
The moist east wind comes marching over the heath to blow its
bagpipes among the bamboos
Then crowds of flowers come out of a sudden from nobody knows
where and dance upon the grass in wild glee
Mother I really think the flowers go to school underground
They do their lessons with doors shut and if they want to
come out to play before it is time their master makes them stand
in a corner
When the rain come they have their holidays
Branches clash together in the forest and the leaves rustle
in the wild wind the thunderclouds clap their giant hands and the
flower children rush out in dresses of pink and yellow and white
Do you know mother their home is in the sky where the stars
are
Havent you see how eager they are to get there Dont you
know why they are in such a hurry
Of course I can guess to whom they raise their arms they
have their mother as I have my own
I long to go over there to the further bank of the river
Where those boats are tied to the bamboo poles in a line
Where men cross over in their boats in the morning with
ploughs on their shoulders to till their faraway fields
Where the cowherds make their lowing cattle swim across to the
riverside pasture
Whence they all come back home in the evening leaving the
jackals to howl in the island overgrown with weeds
Mother if you dont mind I should like to become the boatman
of the ferry when I am grown up
They say there are strange pools hidden behind that high bank
Where flocks of wild ducks come when the rains are over and
thick reeds grow round the margins where waterbirds lay their
eggs
Where snipes with their dancing tails stamp their tiny
footprints upon the clean soft mud
Where in the evening the tall grasses crested with while
flowers invite the moonbeam to float upon their waves
Mother if you dont mind I should like to become the boatman
of the ferryboat when I am grown up
I shall cross and cross back from bank to bank and all the
boys and girls of the village will wonder at me while they are
bathing
When the sun climbs the mid sky and morning wears on to noon
I shall come running to you saying Mother I am hungry
When the day is done and the shadows cower under the trees
I shall come back in the dust
I shall never go away from you into the town to work like
father
Mother if you dont mind I should like to become the boatman
of the ferryboat when I am grown up
Ah me why did they build my
house by the road to the market
town
They moor their laden boats near
my trees
They come and go and wander at
their will
I sit and watch them my time
wears on
Turn them away I cannot And
thus my days pass by
Night and day their steps sound
by my door
Vainly I cry I do not know
you
Some of them are known to my
fingers some to my nostrils the
blood in my veins seems to know
them and some are known to my
dreams
Turn them away I cannot I call
them and say Come to my house
whoever chooses Yes come
In the morning the bell rings in the
temple
They come with their baskets in
their hands
Their feet are rosy red The early
light of dawn is on their faces
Turn them away I cannot I call
them and I say Come to my garden
to gather flowers Come hither
In the midday the gong sounds
at the palace gate
I know not why they leave their
work and linger near my hedge
The flowers in their hair are pale
and faded the notes are languid in
their flutes
Turn them away I cannot I call
them and say The shade is cool
under my trees Come friends
At night the crickets chirp in the
woods
Who is it that comes slowly to my
door and gently knocks
I vaguely see the face not a word
is spoken the stillness of the sky is
all around
Turn away my silent guest I
cannot I look at the face through the
dark and hours of dreams pass by
When I go alone at night to my
lovetryst birds do not sing the wind
does not stir the houses on both sides
of the street stand silent
It is my own anklets that grow loud
at every step and I am ashamed
When I sit on my balcony and listen
for his footsteps leaves do not rustle
on the trees and the water is still in
the river like the sword on the knees
of a sentry fallen asleep
It is my own heart that beats wildly
I do not know how to quiet it
When my love comes and sits by
my side when my body trembles and
my eyelids droop the night darkens
the wind blows out the lamp and the
clouds draw veils over the stars
It is the jewel at my own breast
that shines and gives light I do not
know how to hide it
Then finish the last song and let us
leave
Forget this night when the night is
no more
Whom do I try to clasp in my
arms Dreams can never be made captive
My eager hands press emptiness to
my heart and it bruises my breast
O woman you are not merely the
handiwork of God but also of men
these are ever endowing you with
beauty from their hearts
Poets are weaving for you a web
with threads of golden imagery
painters are giving your form ever
new immortality
The sea gives its pearls the mines
their gold the summer gardens their
flowers to deck you to cover you to
make you more precious
The desire of mens hearts has shed
its glory over your youth
You are one half woman and one
half dream
It was midday when you went
away
The sun was strong in the sky
I had done my work and sat alone
on my balcony when you went away
Fitful gusts came winnowing
through the smells of may distant
fields
The doves cooed tireless in the shade
and a bee strayed in my room hum
ming the news of many distant fields
The village slept in the noonday
heat The road lay deserted
In sudden fits the rustling of the
leaves rose and died
I gazed at the sky and wove in the
blue the letters of a name I had known
while the village slept in the noonday
heat
I had forgotten to braid my hair
The languid breeze played with it upon
my cheek
The river ran unruffled under the
shady bank
The lazy white clouds did not move
I had forgotten to braid my hair
It was midday when you went
away
The dust of the road was hot and
the fields panting
The doves cooed among the dense
leaves
I was alone in my balcony when you
went away
I plucked your flower O world
I pressed it to my heart and the
thorn pricked
When the day waned and it
darkened I found that the flower had
faded but the pain remained
More flowers will come to you with
perfume and pride O world
But my time for flowergathering
is over and through the dark night
I have not my rose only the pain
remains
Peace my heart let the time for
the parting be sweet
Let it not be a death but completeness
Let love melt into memory and pain
into songs
Let the flight through the sky end
in the folding of the wings over the
nest
Let the last touch of your hands be
gentle like the flower of the night
Stand still O Beautiful End for a
moment and say your last words in
silence
I bow to you and hold up my lamp
to light you on your way
I spent my day on the scorching
hot dust of the road
Now in the cool of the evening I
knock at the door of the inn It is
deserted and in ruins
A grim ashath tree spreads its
hungry clutching roots through the
gaping fissures of the walls
Days have been when wayfarers
came here to wash their weary feet
They spread their mats in the
courtyard in the dim light of the
early moon and sat and talked of
strange lands
They woke refreshed in the morning
when birds made them glad and
friendly flowers nodded their heads
at them from the wayside
But no lighted lamp awaited me
when I came here
The black smudges of smoke left by
many a forgotten evening lamp stare
like blind eyes from the wall
Fireflies flit in the bush near the
driedup pond and bamboo branches
fling their shadows on the grass
grown path
I am the guest of no one at the end
of my day
The long night is before me and I
am tired
I hunt for the golden stag
You may smile my friends but I
pursue the vision that eludes me
I run across hills and dales I wander
through nameless lands because I am
hunting for the golden stag
You come and buy in the market
and go back to your homes laden with
goods but the spell of the homeless
winds has touched me I know not when
and where
I have no care in my heart all my
belongings I have left far behind me
I run across hills and dales I wander
through nameless landsbecause I am
hunting for the golden stag
None lives for ever brother and
nothing lasts for long Keep that in
mind and rejoice
Our life is not the one old burden
our path is not the one long
journey
One sole poet has not to sing one
aged song
The flower fades and dies but he
who wears the flower has not to
mourn for it for ever
Brother keep that in mind and
rejoice
There must come a full pause to
weave perfection into music
Life droops toward its sunset to be
drowned in the golden shadows
Love must be called from its play
to drink sorrow and be borne to the
heaven of tears
Brother keep that in min and
rejoice
We hasten to gather our flowers lest
they are plundered by the passing
winds
It quickens our blood and brightens
our eyes to snatch kisses that would
vanish if we delayed
Our life is eager our desires are keen
for time tolls the bell of parting
Brother keep that in mind and
rejoice
There is not time for us to clasp a
thing and crush it and fling it away to
the dust
The hours trip rapidly away hiding
their dreams in their skirts
Our life is short it yields but a
few days for love
Were it for work and drudgery it
would be endlessly long
Brother keep that in mind and
rejoice
Beauty is sweet to us because she
dances to the same fleeting tune with
our lives
Knowledge is precious to us because
we shall never have time to
complete it
All is done and finished in the eternal
Heaven
But earths flowers of illusion are
kept eternally fresh by death
Brother keep that in mind and
rejoice
I often wonder where lie hidden
the boundaries of recognition between
man and the beast whose heart knows
no spoken language
Through what primal paradise in a
remote morning of creation ran the
simple path by which their hearts
visited each other
Those marks of their constant tread
have not been effaced though their
kinship has been long forgotten
Yet suddenly in some wordless
music the dim memory wakes up
and the beast gazes into the mans
face with a tender trust and the
man looks down into its eyes with
amused affection
It seems that the two friends meet
masked and vaguely know each other
through the disguise
At midnight the wouldbe ascetic
announced
This is the time to give up my
home and seek for God Ah who has
held me so long in delusion here
God whispered I but the ears
of the man were stopped
With a baby asleep at her breast
lay his wife peacefully sleeping on
one side of the bed
The man said Who are ye that
have fooled me so long
The voice said again They are
God but he heard it not
The baby cried out in its dream
nestling close to its mother
God commanded Stop fool leave
not thy home but still he heard not
God sighed and complained Why
does my servant wander to seek me
forsaking me
The fair was on before the temple
It had rained from the early morning
and the day came to its end
Brighter than all the gladness of
the crowd was the bright smile of
a girl who bought for a farthing a
whistle of palm leaf
The shrill joy of that whistle floated
above all laughter and noise
An endless throng of people came
and jostled together The road was
muddy the river in flood the field
under water in ceaseless rain
Greater than all the troubles of
the crowd was a little boys trouble
he had not a farthing to buy a painted
stick
His wistful eyes gazing at the shop
made this whole meeting of men so
pitiful
Why do you whisper so faintly in
my ears O Death my Death
When the flowers droop in the
evening and cattle come back to their
stalls you stealthily come to my side
and speak words that I do not
understand
Is this how you must woo and win
me with the opiate of drowsy murmur
and cold kisses O Death my Death
Will there be no proud ceremony
for our wedding
Will you not tie up with a wreath
your tawny coiled locks
Is there none to carry your banner
before you and will not the night be
on fire with your red torchlights
O Death my Death
Come with your conchshells sound
ing come in the sleepless night
Dress me with a crimson mantle
grasp my hand and take me
Let your chariot be ready at my
door with your horses neighing impatiently
Raise my veil and look at my face
proudly O Death my Death
She dwelt on the hillside by edge
of a maizefield near the spring that
flows in laughing rills through the
solemn shadows of ancient trees The
women came there to fill their jars
and travellers would sit there to rest
and talk She worked and dreamed
daily to the tune of the bubbling
stream
One evening the stranger came down
from the cloudhidden peak his locks
were tangled like drowsy snakes We
asked in wonder Who are you
He answered not but sat by the
garrulous stream and silently gazed at
the hut where she dwelt Our hearts
quaked in fear and we came back home
when it was night
Next morning when the women
came to fetch water at the spring by
the deodar trees they found the doors
open in her hut but her voice was gone
and where was her smiling face
The empty jar lay on the floor and her
lamp had burnt itself out in the
corner No one knew where she had
fled to before it was morningand the
stranger had gone
In the month of May the sun grew
strong and the snow melted and we
sat by the spring and wept We
wondered in our mind Is there a
spring in the land where she has gone
and where she can fill her vessel in
these hot thirsty days And we
asked each other in dismay Is there
a land beyond these hills where we
live
It was a summer night the breeze
blew from the south and I sat in her
deserted room where the lamp stood
still unlit When suddenly from
before my eyes the hills vanished like
curtains drawn aside Ah it is
she who comes How are you my
child Are you happy But where
can you shelter under this open sky
And alas our spring is not here to
allay your thirst
Here is the same sky she said
only free from the fencing hills
this is the same stream grown into a
riverthe same earth widened into
a plain Everything is here I
sighed only we are not She
smiled sadly and said You are in
my heart I woke up and heard the
babbling of the stream and the rustling
of the deodars at night
Over the green and yellow ricefields
sweep the shadows of the autumn
clouds followed by the swiftchasing
sun
The bees forget to sip their honey
drunken with light they foolishly hover
and hum
The ducks in the islands of the river
clamour in joy for mere nothing
Let none go back home brothers
this morning let none go to work
Let us take the blue sky by storm
and plunder space as we run
Laughter floats in the air like foam
on the flood
Brothers let us squander our
morning in futile songs
Let your work be bride Listen the
guest has come
Do you hear he is gently shaking
the chain which fastens the door
See that your anklets make no loud
noise and that your step is not over
hurried at meeting him
Let your work be bride the guest
had come in the evening
No it is not the ghostly wind bride
do not be frightened
It is the full moon on a night of
April shadows are pale in the court
yard the sky overhead is bright
Draw your veil over your face if
you must carry the lamp to the door
if you fear
No it is not the ghostly wind bride
do not be frightened
Have no word with him if you are
shy stand aside by the door when you
meet him
If he asks you questions and if
you wish to you can lower you eyes
in silence
Do not let your bracelets jingle
when lamp in hand you lead him in
Have no words with him if your are
shy
Have you not finished you work yet
bride Listen the guest has come
Have you not lit the lamp in the
cowshed
Have you not got ready the offering
basket for the evening service
Have you not put the red lucky
mark at the parting of your hair and
done your toilet for the night
O bride do you hear the guest has
come
Let your work be
Come as you are do not loiter over
your toilet
If your braided hair has loosened if
the parting of your hair be not straight
if the ribbons of your bodice be not
fastened do not mind
Come as you are do not loiter over
your toilet
Come with quick steps over the
grass
If the raddle come from your feet
because of the dew of the rings of bells
upon your feet slacken if pearls drop
out of your chain do not mind
Come with quick steps over the
grass
Do you see the clouds wrapping the
sky
Flocks of cranes fly up from the
further riverbank and fitful gusts of
wind rush over the heath
The anxious cattle run to their stalls
in the village
Do you see the clouds wrapping the
sky
In vain you light your toilet lamp
it flickers and goes out in the
wind
Who can know that your eyelids
have not been touched with lamp
black For your eyes are darker
than rainclouds
In vain you light your toilet lamp
it goes out
Come as you are do not loiter over
your toilet
If the wreath is not woven who
cares if the wristchain had not been
linked let it be
The sky is overcast with cloudsit
is late
Come as you are do not loiter over
your toilet
I asked nothing only stood at the
edge of the wood behind the tree
Languor was still upon the eyes
of the dawn and the dew in the air
The lazy smell of the damp grass
hung in the thin mist above the earth
Under the banyan tree you were
milking the cow with your hands
tender and fresh as butter
And I was standing still
I did not say a word It was the
bird that sang unseen from the thicket
The mango tree was shedding its
flowers upon the village road and the
bees came humming one by one
On the side of the pond the gate of
Shivas temple was opened and the
worshipper had begun his chants
With the vessel on your lap you
were milking the cow
I stood with my empty can
I did not come near you
The sky woke with the sound of
the gong at the temple
The dust was raised in the road
from the hoofs of the driven cattle
With the gurgling pitchers at their
hips women came from the river
Your bracelets were jingling and
foam brimming over the jar
The morning wore on and I did not
come near you
I was walking by the road I do not
know why when the noonday was past
and bamboo branches rustled in the
wind
The prone shadows with their out
stretched arms clung to the feet of
the hurrying light
The koels were weary of their
songs
I was walking by the road I do not
know why
The hut by the side of the water is
shaded by an overhanging tree
Some on was busy with her work
and her bangles made music in the
corner
I stood before this hut I know not
why
The narrow winding road crosses
many a mustard field and many a
mango forest
It passes by the temple of the
village and the market at the river
landingplace
I stopped by this hut I do not know
why
Years ago it was a day of breezy
March when the murmur of the spring
was languorous and mango blossoms
were dropping on the dust
The rippling water leapt and licked
the brass vessel that stood on the
landingstep
I think of that day of breezy March
I do not know why
Shadows are deepening and cattle
returning to their folds
The light is grey upon the lonely
meadows and the villagers are waiting
for the ferry at the bank
I slowly return upon my steps I
do not know why
You walked by the riverside path
with the full pitcher upon your hip
Why did you swiftly turn your face
and peep at me through your fluttering
veil
That gleaming look from the dark
came upon me like a breeze that sends
a shiver through the rippling water
and sweeps away to the shadowy
shore
It came to me like the bird of the
evening that hurriedly flies across the
lampless room from the one open
window to the other and disappears
in the night
You are hidden as a star behind the
hills and I am a passerby upon the
road
But why did you stop for a moment
and glance at my face through your
veil while you walked by the river
side path with the full pitcher upon
your hip
An unbelieving smile flits on your
eyes when I come to you to take my
leave
I have done it so often that you
think I will soon return
To tell you the truth I have the
same doubt in my mind
For the spring days come again
time after time the full moon takes
leave and comes on another visit
the flowers come again and blush
upon their branches year after year
and it is likely that I take my leave
only to come to you again
But keep the illusion awhile do
not send it away with ungentle
haste
When I say I leave you for all
time accept it as true and let a
mist of tears for one moment deepen
the dark rim of your eyes
Then smile as archly as you like
when I come again
O mad superbly drunk
If you kick open your doors and
play the fool in public
If you empty your bag in a night
and snap your fingers at prudence
If you walk in curious paths and
play with useless things
Reck not rhyme or reason
If unfurling your sails before the
storm you snap the rudder in two
Then I will follow you comrade
and be drunken and go to the dogs
I have wasted my days and nights
in the company of steady wise neighbours
Much knowing has turned my hair
grey and much watching has made
my sight dim
For years I have gathered and
heaped up scraps and fragments of
things
Crush them and dance upon them
and scatter them all to the winds
For I know tis the height of wisdom
to be drunken and go the dogs
Let all crooked scruples vanish
let me hopelessly lose my way
Let a gust of wild giddiness come
and sweep me away from my anchors
The world is peopled with worthies
and workers useful and clever
There are men who are easily first
and men who come decently after
Let them be happy and prosper
and let me be foolishly futile
For I know tis the end of all works
to be drunken and go to the dogs
I swear to surrender this moment
all claims to the ranks of the decent
I let go my pride of learning and
judgment of right and of wrong
Ill shatter memorys vessel scattering
the last drop of tears
With the foam of the berryred
wine I will bathe and brighten my
laughter
The badge of the civil and staid
Ill tear into shreds for the nonce
Ill take the holy vow to be worthless
to be drunken and go to the dogs
No my friends I shall never be an
ascetic whatever you may say
I shall never be and ascetic if she
does not take the vow with me
It is my firm resolve that if I
cannot find a shady shelter and a
companion for my penance I shall
never turn ascetic
No my friends I shall never leave
my hearth and home and retire into
the forest solitude if rings no merry
laughter in its echoing shade and if
the end of no saffron mantle flutters
in the wind if its silence is not
deepened by soft whispers
I shall never be an ascetic
Reverend sir forgive this pair of
sinners Spring winds today are
blowing in wild eddies driving dust
and dead leaves away and with them
your lessons are all lost
Do not say father that life is a
vanity
For we have made truce with death
for once and only for a few fragrant
hours we two have been made immortal
Even if the kings army came and
fiercely fell upon us we should sadly
shake our heads and say Brothers
you are disturbing us If you must
have this noisy game go and clatter
your arms elsewhere Since only for
a few fleeting moments we have been
made immortal
If friendly people came and flocked
around us we should humbly bow to
them and say This extravagant good
fortune is an embarrassment to us
Room is scarce in the infinite sky
where we dwell For in the spring
time flowers come in crowds and the
busy wings of bees jostle each other
Our little heaven where dwell only
we two immortals is too absurdly
narrow
To the guests that must go bid
Gods speed and brush away all traces
of their steps
Take to your bosom with a smile
what is easy and simple and near
Today is the festival of phantoms
that know not when they die
Let your laughter be but a meaning
less mirth like twinkles of light on
the ripples
Let your life lightly dance on the
edges of Time like dew on the tip of
a leaf
Strike in chords from your harp
fitful momentary rhythms
You left me and went on your way
I thought I should mourn for you
and set your solitary image in my
heart wrought in a golden song
But ah my evil fortune time is
short
Youth wanes year after year the
spring days are fugitive the frail
flowers die for nothing and the wise
man warns me that life is but a
dewdrop on the lotus leaf
Should I neglect all this to gaze after
one who has turned her back on me
That would be rude and foolish
for time is short
Then come my rainy nights with
pattering feet smile my golden
autumn come careless April scatter
ing your kisses abroad
You come and you and you also
My loves you know we are mortals
Is it wise to break ones heart for the
one who takes her heart away For
time is short
It is sweet to sit in a corner to muse
and write in rhymes that you are all
my world
It is heroic to hug ones sorrow and
determine not to be consoled
But a fresh face peeps across my
door and raise its eyes to my eyes
I cannot but wipe away my tears
and change the tune of my song
For time is short
Free me from the bonds of your
sweetness my love Nor more of this
wine of kisses
This mist of heavy incense stifles
my heart
Open the doors make room for the
morning light
I am lost in you wrapped in the
folds of your caresses
Free me from your spells and give
me back the manhood to offer you my
freed heart
Hands cling to hands and eyes linger
on eyes thus begins the record of our
hearts
It is the moonlit night of March
the sweet smell of henna is in the air
my flute lies on the earth neglected
and your garland of flowers is
unfinished
This love between you and me is
simple as a song
Your veil of the saffron colour
makes my eyes drunk
The jasmine wreath that you wove
me thrills to my heart like praise
It is a game of giving and with
holding revealing and screening again
some smiles and some little shyness
and some sweet useless struggles
This love between you and me is
simple as a song
No mystery beyond the present
no striving for the impossible no
shadow behind the charm no groping
in the depth of the dark
This love between you and me is
simple as a song
We do not stray out of all words
into the ever silent we do not raise
our hands to the void for things
beyond hope
It is enough what we give and we
get
We have not crushed the joy to
the utmost to wring from it the wine
of pain
This love between you and me is
simple as a song
When the two sisters go to fetch
water they come to this spot and
they smile
They must be aware of somebody
who stands behind the trees when
ever they go to fetch water
The two sisters whisper to each
other when they pass this spot
They must have guessed the secret
of that somebody who stands behind
the trees whenever they go to
fetch water
Their pitchers lurch suddenly and
water spills when they reach this
spot
They must have found out that
somebodys heart is beating who
stands behind the trees whenever
they go to fetch water
The two sisters glance at each other
when they come to this spot and they
smile
There is a laughter in their swift
stepping feet which makes confusion
in somebodys mind who stands behind
the trees whenever they go to
fetch water
Day after day he comes and goes
away
Go and give him a flower from my
hair my friend
If he asks who was it that sent it I
entreat you do not tell him my name
for he only comes and goes away
He sits on the dust under the tree
Spread there a seat with flowers and
leaves my friend
His eyes are sad and they bring
sadness to my heart
He does not speak what he has in
mind he only comes and goes away
Why did he choose to come to my
door the wandering youth when the
day dawned
As I come in and out I pass by him
every time and my eyes are caught by
his face
I know not if I should speak to him
or keep silent Why did he choose to
come to my door
The cloudy nights in July are dark
the sky is soft blue in the autumn the
spring days are restless with the south
wind
He weaves his songs with fresh
tunes every time
I turn from my work and my eyes
fill with the mist Why did he choose
to come to my door
When she passed by me with quick
steps the end of her skirt touched
me
From the unknown island of a
heart came a sudden warm breath of
spring
A flutter of a flitting touch brushed
me and vanished in a moment like a
torn flower petal blown in the breeze
It fell upon my heart like a sigh of
her body and whisper of her heart
Do not keep to yourself the secret of
your heart my friend
Say it to me only to me in secret
You who smile so gently softly
whisper my heart will hear it not my
ears
The night is deep the house is
silent the birds nests are shrouded
with sleep
Speak to me through hesitating
tears through faltering smiles through
sweet shame and pain the secret of
your heart
Speak to me my love Tell me in
words what you sang
The night is dark The stars are
lost in clouds The wind is sighing
through the leaves
I will let loose my hair My blue
cloak will cling round me like night I
will clasp your head to my bosom and
there in the sweet loneliness murmur
on your heart I will shut my eyes
and listen I will not look in your face
When your words are ended we will
sit still and silent Only the trees will
whisper in the dark
The night will pale The day will
dawn We shall look at each others
eyes and go on our different paths
Speak to me my love Tell me in
words what you sang
What comes from your willing
hands I take I beg for nothing
more
Yes yes I know you modest
mendicant you ask for all that one
has
If there be a stray flower for me
I will wear it in my heart
But if there be thorns
I will endure them
Yes yes I know you modest
mendicant you ask for all that one
has
If but once you should raise your
loving eyes to my face it would make
my life sweet beyond death
But if there be only cruel
glances
I will keep them piercing my
heart
Yes yes I know you modest
mendicant you ask for all that one
has
Trust love even if it brings sorrow
Do not close up your heart
Ah no my friend your words are
dark I cannot understand them
Pleasure is frail like a dewdrop
while it laughs it dies But sorrow is
strong and abiding Let sorrowful
love wake in your eyes
Ah no my friend your words are
dark I cannot understand them
The lotus blooms in the sight of
the sun and loses all that it has It
would not remain in bud in the
eternal winter mist
Ah no my friend your words are
dark I cannot understand them
Your questioning eyes are sad They
seek to know my meaning as the moon
would fathom the sea
I have bared my life before your
eyes from end to end with nothing
hidden or held back That is why you
know me not
If it were only a gem I could break
it into a hundred pieces and string
them into a chain to put on your neck
If it were only a flower round and
small and sweet I could pluck it from
its stem to set it in your hair
But it is a heart my beloved
Where are its shores and its bottom
You know not the limits of this
kingdom still you are its queen
If it were only a moment of pleasure
it would flower in an easy smile and
you could see it and read it in a
moment
If it were merely a pain it would
melt in limpid tears reflecting its
inmost secret without a word
But it is love my beloved
Its pleasure and pain are boundless
and endless its wants and wealth
It is as near to you as your life but
you can never wholly know it
Do not go my love without asking
my leave
I have watched all night and now
my eyes are heavy with sleep
I fear lest I lose you when Im
sleeping
Do not go my love without asking
my leave
I start up and stretch my hands to
touch you I ask myself Is it a
dream
Could I but entangle your feet with
my heart and hold them fast to my
breast
Do not go my love without asking
my leave
My love once upon a time your poet
launched a great epic in his mind
Alas I was not careful and it struck
your ringing anklets and came to
grief
It broke up into scraps of songs and
lay scattered at your feet
All my cargo of the stories of old
wars was tossed by the laughing waves
and soaked in tears and sank
You must make this loss good to me
my love
If my claims to immortal fame after
death are scattered make me immortal
while I live
And I will not mourn for my loss nor
blame you
I want to give you something my child for we are drifting in the
stream of the world
Our lives will be carried apart and our love forgotten
But I am not so foolish as to hope that I could buy your heart
with my gifts
Young is your life your path long and you drink the love we
bring you at one draught and turn and run away from us
You have your play and your playmates What harm is there if
you have no time or thought for us
We indeed have leisure enough in old age to count the days
that are past to cherish in our hearts what our hands have lost
for ever
The river runs swift with a song breaking through all
barriers But the mountain stays and remembers and follows her
with his love
Clouds rumbling in the sky teeming rain
I sit on the river bank sad and alone
The sheaves lie gathered harvest has ended
The river is swollen and fierce in its flow
As we cut the paddy it started to rain
One small paddyfield no one but me
Floodwaters twisting and swirling everywhere
Trees on the far bank smear shadows like ink
On a village painted on deep morning grey
On this side a paddyfield no one but me
Who is this steering close to the shore
Singing I feel that she is someone I know
The sails are filled wide she gazes ahead
Waves break helplessly against the boat each side
I watch and feel I have seen her face before
Oh to what foreign land do you sail
Come to the bank and moor your boat for a while
Go where you want to give where you care to
But come to the bank a moment show your smile
Take away my golden paddy when you sail
Take it take as much as you can load
Is there more No none I have put it aboard
My intense labour here by the river
I have parted with it all layer upon layer
Now take me as well be kind take me aboard
No room no room the boat is too small
Loaded with my gold paddy the boat is full
Across the rainsky clouds heave to and fro
On the bare riverbank I remain alone
What had has gone the golden boat took all
Mother let us imagine we are travelling and passing through a
strange and dangerous country
You are riding in a palanquin and I am trotting by you on a
red horse
It is evening and the sun goes down The waste of Joradighi
lies wan and grey before us The land is desolate and barren
You are frightened and thinkingI know not where we have come
to
I say to you Mother do not be afraid
The meadow is prickly with spiky grass and through it runs
a narrow broken path
There are no cattle to be seen in the wide field they have
gone to their village stalls
It grows dark and dim on the land and sky and we cannot tell
where we are going
Suddenly you call me and ask me in a whisper What light is
that near the bank
Just then there bursts out a fearful yell and figures come
running towards us
You sit crouched in your palanquin and repeat the names of the
gods in prayer
The bearers shaking in terror hide themselves in the thorny
bush
I shout to you Dont be afraid mother I am here
With long sticks in their hands and hair all wild about their
heads they come nearer and nearer
I shout Have a care you villains One step more and you are
dead men
They give another terrible yell and rush forward
You clutch my hand and say Dear boy for heavens sake keep
away from them
I say Mother just you watch me
Then I spur my horse for a wild gallop and my sword and
buckler clash against each other
The fight becomes so fearful mother that it would give you
a cold shudder could you see it from your palanquin
Many of them fly and a great number are cut to pieces
I know you are thinking sitting all by yourself that your
boy must be dead by this time
But I come to you all stained with blood and sayMother the
fight is over now
You come out and kiss me pressing me to your heart and you
say to yourself
I dont know what I should do if I hadnt my boy to escort
me
A thousand useless things happen day after day and why
couldnt such a thing come true by chance
It would be like a story in a book
My brother would say Is it possible I always thought he was
so delicate
Our village people would all say in amazement Was it not
lucky that the boy was with his mother
I paced alone on the road across the field while the sunset was
hiding its last gold like a miser
The daylight sank deeper and deeper into the darkness and the
widowed land whose harvest had been reaped lay silent
Suddenly a boys shrill voice rose into the sky He traversed
the dark unseen leaving the track of his song across the hush of
the evening
His village home lay there at the end of the waste land
beyond the sugarcane field hidden among the shadows of the banana
and the slender areca palm the coconut and the dark green jack
fruit trees
I stopped for a moment in my lonely way under the starlight
and saw spread before me the darkened earth surrounding with her
arms countless homes furnished with cradles and beds mothers
hearts and evening lamps and young lives glad with a gladness that
knows nothing of its value for the world
The morning sea of silence broke into ripples of bird songs
and the flowers were all merry by the roadside
and the wealth of gold was scattered through the rift of the clouds
while we busily went on our way and paid no heed
We sang no glad songs nor played
we went not to the village for barter
we spoke not a word nor smiled
we lingered not on the way
We quickened our pace more and more as the time sped by
The sun rose to the mid sky and doves cooed in the shade
Withered leaves danced and whirled in the hot air of noon
The shepherd boy drowsed and dreamed in the shadow of the banyan tree
and I laid myself down by the water
and stretched my tired limbs on the grass
My companions laughed at me in scorn
they held their heads high and hurried on
they never looked back nor rested
they vanished in the distant blue haze
They crossed many meadows and hills
and passed through strange faraway countries
All honor to you heroic host of the interminable path
Mockery and reproach pricked me to rise
but found no response in me
I gave myself up for lost
in the depth of a glad humiliation
in the shadow of a dim delight
The repose of the sunembroidered green gloom
slowly spread over my heart
I forgot for what I had traveled
and I surrendered my mind without struggle
to the maze of shadows and songs
At last when I woke from my slumber and opened my eyes
I saw thee standing by me flooding my sleep with thy smile
How I had feared that the path was long and wearisome
and the struggle to reach thee was hard
Say of him what you please but I know my childs failings
I do not love him because he is good but because he is my
little child
How should you know how dear he can be when you try to weigh
his merits against his faults
When I must punish him he becomes all the more a part of my
being
When I cause his tears to come my heart weeps with him
I alone have a right to blame and punish for he only may
chastise who loves
Lips language to lips ears
Two drinking each others heart it seems
Two roving loves who have left home
pilgrims to the confluence of lips
Two waves rise by the law of love
to break and die on two sets of lips
Two wild desires craving each other
meet at last at the bodys limits
Loves writing a song in dainty letters
layers of kisscalligraphy on lips
Plucking flowers from two sets of lips
perhaps to thread them into a chain later
This sweet union of lips
is the red marriagebed of a pair of smiles
Mother the light has grown grey in the sky I do not know what
the time is
There is no fun in my play so I have come to you It is
Saturday our holiday
Leave off your work mother sit here by the window and tell
me where the desert of Tepantar in the fairy tale is
The shadow of the rains has covered the day from end to end
The fierce lightning is scratching the sky with its nails
When the clouds rumble and it thunders I love to be afraid
in my heart and cling to you
When the heavy rain patters for hours on the bamboo leaves
and our windows shake and rattle at the gusts of wind I like to
sit alone in the room mother with you and hear you talk about
the desert of Tepantar in the fairy tale
Where is it mother on the shore of what sea at the foot of
what hills in the kingdom of what king
There are no hedges there to mark the fields no footpath
across it by which the villagers reach their village in the
evening or the woman who gathers dry sticks in the forest can
bring her load to the market With patches of yellow grass in the
sand and only one tree where the pair of wise old birds have their
nest lies the desert of Tepantar
I can imagine how on just such a cloudy day the young son
of the king is riding alone on a grey horse through the desert in
search of the princess who lies imprisoned in the giants palace
across that unknown water
When the haze of the rain comes down in the distant sky and
lightning starts up like a sudden fit of pain does he remember his
unhappy mother abandoned by the king sweeping the cowstall and
wiping her eyes while he rides through the desert of Tepantar in
the fairy tale
See mother it is almost dark before the day is over and
thee are no travellers yonder on the village road
The shepherd boy has gone home early from the pasture and men
have left their fields to sit on mats under the eaves of their
huts watching the scowling clouds
Mother I have left all my books on the shelfdo not ask me
to do my lessons now
When I grow up and am bid like my father I shall learn all
that must be learnt
But just for today tell me mother where the desert of
Tepantar in the fairy tale is
Come and hire me I cried while in the morning I was walking on the stonepaved road
Sword in hand the King came in his chariot
He held my hand and said I will hire you with my power
But his power counted for nought and he went away in his chariot
In the heat of the midday the houses stood with shut doors
I wandered along the crooked lane
An old man came out with his bag of gold
He pondered and said I will hire you with my money
He weighed his coins one by one but I turned away
It was evening The garden hedge was all aflower
The fair maid came out and said I will hire you with a smile
Her smile paled and melted into tears and she went back alone into the dark
The sun glistened on the sand and the sea waves broke waywardly
A child sat playing with shells
He raised his head and seemed to know me and said I hire you with nothing
From thenceforward that bargain struck in childs play made me a free man
I am small because I am a little child I shall be big when I am
as old as my father is
My teacher will come and say It is late bring your slate
and your books
I shall tell him  Do you not know I am as big as father And
I must not have lessons any more
My master will wonder and say He can leave his books if he
likes for he is grown up
I shall dress myself and walk to the fair where the crowd is
thick
My uncle will come rushing up to me and say You will get
lost my boy let me carry you
I shall answer Cant you see uncle I am as big as father
I must go to the fair alone
Uncle will say Yes he can go wherever he likes for he is
grown up
Mother will come from her bath when I am giving money to my
nurse for I shall know how to open the box with my key
Mother will say What are you about naughty child
I shall tell her Mother dont you know I am as big as
father and I must give silver to my nurse
Mother will say to herself He can give money to whom he
likes for he is grown up
In the holiday time in October father will come home and
thinking that I am still a baby will bring for me from the town
little shoes and small silken frocks
I shall say Father give them to my data for I am as big
as you are
Father will think and say He can buy his own clothes if he
likes for he is grown up
On the day when the lotus bloomed alas my mind was straying
and I knew it not My basket was empty and the flower remained unheeded
Only now and again a sadness fell upon me and I started up from my
dream and felt a sweet trace of a strange fragrance in the south wind
That vague sweetness made my heart ache with longing and it seemed to
me that is was the eager breath of the summer seeking for its completion
I knew not then that it was so near that it was mine and that this
perfect sweetness had blossomed in the depth of my own heart
Imagine mother that you are to stay at home and I am to travel
into strange lands
Imagine that my boat is ready at the landing fully laden
Now think well mother before you say what I shall bring for
you when I come back
Mother do you want heaps and heaps of gold
There by the banks of golden streams fields are full of
golden harvest
And in the shade of the forest path the golden champ flower
drop on the ground
I will gather them all for you in many hundred baskets
Mother do you want pearls big as the raindrops of autumn
I shall cross to the pearl island shore
There in the early morning light pearls tremble on the meadow
flowers pearls drop on the grass and pearls are scattered on the
sand in spray by the wild seawaves
My brother shall have a pair of horses with wings to fly among
the clouds
For father I shall bring a magic pen that without his
knowing will write of itself
For you mother I must have the casket and jewel that cost
seven kings their kingdom
Sullen clouds are gathering fast over the black fringe of the
forest
O child do not go out
The palm trees in a row by the lake are smiting their heads
against the dismal sky the crows with their dragged wings are
silent on the tamarind branches and the eastern bank of the river
is haunted by a deepening gloom
Our cow is lowing loud ties at the fence
O child wait here till I bring her into the stall
Men have crowded into the flooded field to catch the fishes
as they escape from the overflowing ponds the rainwater is
running in rills through the narrow lanes like a laughing boy who
has run away from his mother to tease her
Listen someone is shouting for the boatman at the ford
O child the daylight is dim and the crossing at the ferry
is closed
The sky seems to ride fast upon the madly rushing rain the
water in the river is loud and impatient women have hastened home
early from the Ganges with their filled pitchers
The evening lamps must be made ready
O child do not go out
The road to the market is desolate the lane to the river is
slippery The wind is roaring and struggling among the bamboo
branches like a wild beast tangled in a net
The night was dark when she went away and the slept
The night is dark now and I call for her Come back my
darling the world is asleep and no one would know if you came
for a moment while stars are gazing at stars
She went away when the trees were in bud and the spring was
young
Now the flowers are in high bloom and I call Come back my
darling The children gather and scatter flowers in reckless sport
And if you come and take one little blossom no one will miss it
Those that used to play are playing still so spendthrift is
life
I listen to their chatter and call Come back my darling
for mothers heart is full to the brim with love and if you come
to snatch only one little kiss from her no one will grudge it
The boat of the boatman Madhu is moored at the wharf of Rajgunj
It is uselessly laden with jute and has been lying there idle
for ever so long
If he would only lend me his boat I should man her with a
hundred oars and hoist sails five or six or seven
I should never steer her to stupid markets
I should sail the seven seas and the thirteen rivers of
fairyland
But mother you wont weep for me in a corner
I am not going into the forest like Ramachandra to come back
only after fourteen years
I shall become the prince of the story and fill my boat with
whatever I like
I shall take my friend Ashu with me We shall sail merrily
across the ever seas and the thirteen rivers of fairyland
We shall set sail in the early morning light
When at noontide you are bathing at the pond we shall be in
the land of a strange king
We shall pass the ford of Tirpurni and leave behind us the
desert of Tepantar
When we come back it will be getting dark and I shall tell
you of all that we have seen
I shall cross the seven seas and the thirteen rivers of
fairyland
The sleep that flits on babys eyesdoes anybody know from where
it comes Yes there is a rumour that it has its dwelling where
in the fairy village among shadows of the forest dimly lit with
glowworms there hang two shy buds of enchantment From there it
comes to kiss babys eyes
The smile that flickers on babys lips when he sleepsdoes
anybody know where it was born Yes there is a rumour that a young
pale beam of a crescent moon touched the edge of a vanishing autumn
cloud and there the smile was first born in the dream of a dew
washed morningthe smile that flickers on babys lips when he
sleeps
The sweet soft freshness hat blooms on babys limbsdoes
anybody know where it was hidden so long Yes when the mother was
a young girl it lay pervading her heart in tender and silent
mystery of lovethe sweet soft freshness that has bloomed on
babys limbs
The sun of the first day
Put the question
To the new manifestation of life
Who are you
There was no answer
Years passed by
The last sun of the last day
Uttered the question
on the shore of the western sea
In the hush of evening
Who are you
No answer came again
THE tame bird was in a cage the free bird was in the forest
They met when the time came it was a decree of fate
The free bird cries O my love let us fly to the wood
The cage bird whispers Come hither let us both live in the cage
Says the free bird Among bars where is there room to spread ones wings
Alas cries the caged bird I should not know where to sit perched in the sky
The free bird cries My darling sing the songs of the woodlands
The cage bird sings Sit by my side Ill teach you the speech of the learned
The forest bird cries No ah no songs can never be taught
The cage bird says Alas for me I know not the songs of the woodlands
There love is intense with longing but they never can fly wing to wing
Through the bars of the cage they look and vain is their wish to know each other
They flutter their wings in yearning and sing Come closer my love
The free bird cries It cannot be I fear the closed doors of the cage
The cage bird whispers Alas my wings are powerless and dead
Ah who was it coloured that little frock my child and covered
your sweet limbs with that little red tunic
You have come out in the morning to play in the courtyard
tottering and tumbling as you run
But who was it coloured that little frock my child
What is it makes you laugh my little lifebud
Mother smiles at you standing on the threshold
She claps her hands and her bracelets jingle and you dance
with your bamboo stick in your hand like a tiny little shepherd
But what is it makes you laugh my little lifebud
O beggar what do you bed for clinging to your mothers neck
with both your hands
O greedy heart shall I pluck the world like a fruit from the
sky to place it on your little rosy palm
O beggar what are you begging for
The wind carries away in glee the tinkling of your anklet
bells
The sun smiles and watches your toilet
The sky watches over you when you sleep in your mothers arms
and the morning comes tiptoe to your bed and kisses your eyes
The wind carried away in glee the tinkling of your anklet
bells
The fairy mistress of dreams is coming towards you flying
through the twilight sky
The worldmother keeps her seat by you in your mothers heart
He who plays his music to the stars is standing at your window
with his flute
And the fairy mistress of dreams is coming towards you flying
through the twilight sky
Why do you sit there on the floor so quiet and silent tell me
mother dear
The rain is coming in through the open window making you all
wet and you dont mind it
Do you hear the gong striking four It is time for my brother
to come home from school
What has happened to you that you look so strange
Havent you got a letter from father today
I saw the postman bringing letters in his bag for almost
everybody in the town
Only fathers letters he keeps to read himself I am sure the
postman is a wicked man
But dont be unhappy about that mother dear
Tomorrow is market day in the next village You ask your maid
to buy some pens and papers
I myself will write all fathers letters you will not find
a single mistake
I shall write from A right up to K
But mother why do you smile
You dont believe that I can write as nicely as father does
But I shall rule my paper carefully and write all the letters
beautifully big
When I finish my writing do you think I shall be so foolish
as father and drop it into the horrid postmans bag
I shall bring it to you myself without waiting and letter by
letter help you to read my writing
I know the postman does not like to give you the really nice
letters
Every morning this dog very attached to me
Quietly keeps sitting near my seat
Till touching its head
I recognize its company
This recognition gives it so much joy
Pure delight ripples through its entire body
Among all dumb creatures
It is the only living being
That has seen the whole man
Beyond what is good or bad in him
It has seen
For his love it can sacrifice its life
It can love him too for the sake of love alone
For it is he who shows the way
To the vast world pulsating with life
When I see its deep devotion
The offer of its whole being
I fail to understand
By its sheer instinct
What truth it has discovered in man
By its silent anxious piteous looks
It cannot communicate what it understands
But it has succeeded in conveying to me
Among the whole creation
What is the true status of man
I was not aware of the moment
when I first crossed the threshold of this life
What was the power that made me open out into this vast mystery
like a bud in the forest at midnight
When in the morning I looked upon the light
I felt in a moment that I was no stranger in this world
that the inscrutable without name and form
had taken me in its arms in the form of my own mother
Even so in death the same unknown will appear as ever known to me
And because I love this life
I know I shall love death as well
The child cries out
when from the right breast the mother takes it away
in the very next moment to find in the left one its consolation

Mother I do want to leave off my lessons now I have been at my
book all the morning
You say it is only twelve oclock Suppose it isnt any later
cant you ever think it is afternoon when it is only twelve
oclock
I can easily imagine now that the sun has reached the edge of
that ricefield and the old fisherwoman is gathering herbs for
her supper by the side of the pond
I can just shut my eyes and think that the shadows are growing
darker under the madar tree and the water in the pond looks shiny
black
If twelve oclock can come in the night why cant the night
come when it is twelve oclock
I seem to have loved you in numberless forms numberless times…
In life after life in age after age forever
My spellbound heart has made and remade the necklace of songs
That you take as a gift wear round your neck in your many forms
In life after life in age after age forever
Whenever I hear old chronicles of love its ageold pain
Its ancient tale of being apart or together
As I stare on and on into the past in the end you emerge
Clad in the light of a polestar piercing the darkness of time
You become an image of what is remembered forever
You and I have floated here on the stream that brings from the fount
At the heart of time love of one for another
We have played along side millions of lovers shared in the same
Shy sweetness of meeting the same distressful tears of farewell
Old love but in shapes that renew and renew forever
Today it is heaped at your feet it has found its end in you
The love of all man’s days both past and forever
Universal joy universal sorrow universal life
The memories of all loves merging with this one love of ours –
And the songs of every poet past and forever
At dawn shey departed
My mind tried to console me
 Everything is Maya
Angrily I replied
Heres this sewing box on the table
that flowerpot on the terrace
this monogrammed handfan on the bed
all these are real
My mind said Yet think again
I rejoined  You better stop
Look at this storybook
the hairpin halfway amongst its leaves
signaling the rest is unread
if all these things are Maya
then why should shey be more unreal 
My mind becomes silent
A friend arrived and says
That which is good is real
it is never nonexistent
entire world preserves and cherishes it its chest
like a precious jewel in a necklace
I replied in anger How do you know
Is a body not good Where did that body go 
Like a small boy in a rage hitting his mother
I began to strike at everything in this world
that gave me shelter
And I screamed The world is treacherous
Suddenly I was startled
It seemed like someone admonished me You ungrateful 
I looked at the crescent moon
hidden behind the tamarisk tree outside my window
As if the dear departed one is smiling
and playing hideandseek with me
From the depth of darkness punctuated by scattered stars
came a rebuke when I let you grasp me you call it an deception
and yet when I remain concealed
why do you hold on to your faith in me with such conviction 
No more noisy loud words from mesuch is my masters will
Henceforth I deal in whispers
The speech of my heart will be carried on in murmurings of a song
Men hasten to the Kings market All the buyers and sellers are there
But I have my untimely leave in the middle of the day in the thick of work
Let then the flowers come out in my garden though it is not their time
and let the midday bees strike up their lazy hum
Full many an hour have I spent in the strife of the good and the evil
but now it is the pleasure of my playmate of the empty days to draw my heart on to him
and I know not why is this sudden call to what useless inconsequence

When I called you in your garden
Mango blooms were rich in fragrance
Why did you remain so distant
Keep your doors so tightly fastened
Blossoms grew to ripe fruitclusters
Your rejected my cuppded handfuls
Closed your eyes to perfectness
In the fierce harsh storms of Baisakh
Golden ripened fruit fell tumbling
Dust I said defiles such offerings
Let your hands be heaven to them
Still you showed no friendliness
Lampless were your doors at evening
Pitchblack as I played my vina
How the starlight twanged my heartstrings
How I set my vina dancing
You showed no responsiveness
Sad birds twittered sleeplessly
Calling calling lost companions
Gone the right time for our union
Low the moon while still you brooded
Sunk in lonely pensiveness
Who can understand another
Heart cannot restrain its passion
I had hoped that some remaining
Tearsoaked memories would sway you
Stir your feet to lightsomeness
Moon fell at the feet of morning
Loosened from the nights fading necklace
While you slept O did my Vina
Lull you with its heartache Did you
Dream at least of happiness
When the gong sounds ten in the morning and I walk to school by our
lane
Every day I meet the hawker crying Bangles crystal
bangles
There is nothing to hurry him on there is no road he must
take no place he must go to no time when he must come home
I wish I were a hawker spending my day in the road crying
Bangles crystal bangles
When at four in the afternoon I come back from the school
I can see through the gate of that house the gardener digging
the ground
He does what he likes with his spade he soils his clothes
with dust nobody takes him to task if he gets baked in the sun or
gets wet
I wish I were a gardener digging away at the garden with
nobody to stop me from digging
Just as it gets dark in the evening and my mother sends me to
bed
I can see through my open window the watchman walking up and
down
The lane is dark and lonely and the streetlamp stands like
a giant with one red eye in its head
The watchman swings his lantern and walks with his shadow at
his side and never once goes to bed in his life
I wish I were a watchman walking the streets all night
chasing the shadows with my lantern
The song I came to sing
remains unsung to this day
I have spent my days in stringing
and in unstringing my instrument
The time has not come true
the words have not been rightly set
only there is the agony
of wishing in my heart…
I have not seen his face
nor have I listened to his voice
only I have heard his gentle footsteps
from the road before my house…
But the lamp has not been lit
and I cannot ask him into my house
I live in the hope of meeting with him
but this meeting is not yet
WE are to play the game of death tonight my bride and I
The night is black the clouds in the sky are capricious and the waves are raving at sea
We have left our bed of dreams flung open the door and come out my bride and I
We sit upon a swing and the storm winds give us a wild push from behind
My bride starts up with fear and delight she trembles and clings to my breast
Long have I served her tenderly
I made for her a bed of flowers and I closed the doors to shut out the rude light from her eyes
I kissed her gently on her lips and whispered softly in her ears till she half swooned in languor
She was lost in the endless mist of vague sweetness
She answered not to my touch my songs failed to arouse her
Tonight has come to us the call of the storm from the wild
My bride has shivered and stood up she has clasped my hand and come out
Her hair is flying in the wind her veil is fluttering her garland rustles over her breast
The push of death has swung her into life
We are face to face and heart to heart my bride and I
When I bring you coloured toys my child I understand why there
is such a play of colours on clouds on water and why flowers are
painted in tintswhen I give coloured toys to you my child
When I sing to make you dance I truly know why there is music
in leaves and why waves send their chorus of voices to the heart
of the listening earthwhen I sing to make you dance
When I bring sweet things to your greedy hands I know why
there is honey in the cup of the flower and why fruits are
secretly filled with sweet juicewhen I bring sweet things to your
greedy hands
When I kiss your face to make you smile my darling I surely
understand what pleasure streams from the sky in morning light and
what delight the summer breeze brings to my bodywhen I kiss you
to make you smile
If the day is done
if birds sing no more
if the wind has flagged tired
then draw the veil of darkness thick upon me
even as thou hast wrapt the earth with the coverlet of sleep
and tenderly closed the petals of the drooping lotus at dusk
From the traveler
whose sack of provisions is empty before the voyage is ended
whose garment is torn and dustladen
whose strength is exhausted
remove shame and poverty
and renew his life like a flower under the cover of thy kindly night

WHEN I go alone at night to my lovetryst birds do not sing the wind does not stir the houses on both sides of the street stand silent
It is my own anklets that grow loud at every step and I am ashamed
When I sit on my balcony and listen for his footsteps leaves do not rustle on the trees and the water is still in the river like the sword on the knees of a sentry fallen asleep
It is my own heart that beats wildly I do not know how to quiet it
When my love comes and sits by my side when my body trembles and my eyelids droop the night darkens the wind blows out the lamp and the clouds draw veils over the stars
It is the jewel at my own breast that shines and gives light I do not know how to hide it
WHEN the two sisters go to fetch water they come to this spot and they smile
They must be aware of somebody who stands behind the trees whenever they go to fetch water
The two sisters whisper to each other when they pass this spot
They must have guessed the secret of that somebody who stands behind the trees whenever they go to fetch water
Their pitchers lurch suddenly and water spills when they reach this spot
They must have found out that somebodys heart is beating who stands behind the trees whenever they go to fetch water
The two sisters glance at each other when they come to this spot and they smile
There is a laughter in their swiftstepping feet which makes confusion in somebodys mind who stands behind the trees whenever they go to fetch water
This is my delight
thus to wait and watch at the wayside
where shadow chases light
and the rain comes in the wake of the summer
Messengers with tidings from unknown skies
greet me and speed along the road
My heart is glad within
and the breath of the passing breeze is sweet
From dawn till dusk I sit here before my door
and I know that of a sudden
the happy moment will arrive when I shall see
In the meanwhile I smile and I sing all alone
In the meanwhile the air is filling with the perfume of promise

I came out alone on my way to my tryst
But who is this that follows me in the silent dark
I move aside to avoid his presence but I escape him not
He makes the dust rise from the earth with his swagger
he adds his loud voice to every word that I utter
He is my own little self my lord he knows no shame
but I am ashamed to come to thy door in his company
