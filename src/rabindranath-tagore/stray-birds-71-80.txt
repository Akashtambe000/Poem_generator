71
THE woodcutter's axe begged for its handle from the tree
The tree gave it
72
IN my solitude of heart
I feel the sigh of this widowed evening
veiled with mist and rain
73
CHASTITY
is a wealth that comes from
abundance of love
74
THE mist
like love
plays upon the heart of the hills
and brings out surprises of beauty
75
WE read the world wrong
and say that it deceives us
76
THE poet wind is out over the sea
and the forest to seek his own voice
77
EVERY child
comes with the message
that God is not yet discouraged
of man
78
THE grass seeks her crowd in the earth
The tree seeks his solitude of the sky
79
MAN barricades against himself
80
YOUR voice my friend
wanders in my heart
like the muffled sound of the sea
among these listening pines
