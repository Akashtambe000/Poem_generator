1
STRAY birds of summer come to my window
to sing and fly away
And yellow leaves of autumn
which have no songs
flutter and fall there with a sigh
2
O TROUPE of little vagrants of the world
leave your footprints in my words
3
THE world puts off its mask of vastness to its lover
It becomes small as one song
as one kiss of the eternal
4
IT is the tears of the earth
that keep her smiles in bloom
5
THE mighty desert is burning
for the love of a blade of grass
who shakes her head and laughs
and flies
away
6
IF you shed tears when you miss the sun
you also miss the stars
7
THE sands in your way beg for your song
and your movement
dancing water
Will you carry the burden of their lameness
8
HER wistful face haunts my dreams
like the rain at night
9
ONCE we dreamt that we were strangers
We wake up to find that we were dear to each other
10
SORROW is hushed into peace in my heart
like the evening among the silent trees
