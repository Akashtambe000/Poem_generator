Speak to me my love Tell me in
words what you sang
The night is dark The stars are
lost in clouds The wind is sighing
through the leaves
I will let loose my hair My blue
cloak will cling round me like night I
will clasp your head to my bosom and
there in the sweet loneliness murmur
on your heart I will shut my eyes
and listen I will not look in your face
When your words are ended we will
sit still and silent Only the trees will
whisper in the dark
The night will pale The day will
dawn We shall look at each other's
eyes and go on our different paths
Speak to me my love Tell me in
words what you sang
