whose sparks are the stars
82
LET life be beautiful like summer flowers
and death like autumn leaves

HE who wants to do good knocks at the gate
he who loves
finds the gate open

in life the one becomes many
Religion will be one
when God is dead

therefore he is her slave
and her master

'HOW far are you from me O Fruit?'
'I am hidden in your heart O Flower.'
87

but not seen in the day

'YOU are the big drop of dew under the lotus leaf
I am the smaller one on its upper side
' said the dewdrop to the lake

THE scabbard is content to be dull
when it protects the keenness of the sword

IN darkness
the One appears as uniform
in the light
the One appears as manifold
