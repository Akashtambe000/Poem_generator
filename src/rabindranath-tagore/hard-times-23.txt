Music is silenced the dark descending slowly
Has stripped unending skies of all companions
Weariness grips your limbs and within the locked horizons
Dumbly ring the bells of hugely gathering fears
Still O bird O sightless bird
Not yet not yet the time to furl your wings
It's not melodious woodlands but the leaps and falls
Of an ocean's drowsy booming
Not a grove bedecked with flowers but a tumult flecked with foam
Where is the shore that stored your buds and leaves
Where the nest and the branch's hold
Still O bird my sightless bird
Not yet not yet the time to furl your wings
Stretching in front of you the night's immensity
Hides the western hill where sleeps the distant sun
Still with bated breath the world is counting time and swimming
Across the shoreless dark a crescent moon
Has thinly just appeared upon the dim horizon
But O my bird O sightless bird
Not yet not yet the time to furl your wings
From upper skies the stars with pointing fingers
Intently watch your course and death's impatience
Lashes at you from the deeps in swirling waves
And sad entreaties line the farthest shore
With hands outstretched and crooning 'Come O come!'
Still O bird O sightless bird
Not yet not yet the time to furl your wings
All that is past your fears and loves and hopes
All that is lost your words and lamentation
No longer yours a home nor a bed composed of flowers
For wings are all you have and the sky's broadening countryard
And the dawn steeped in darkness lacking all direction
Dear bird my sightless bird
Not yet not yet the time to furl your wings
