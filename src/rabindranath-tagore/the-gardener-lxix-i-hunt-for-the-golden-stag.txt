I hunt for the golden stag
You may smile my friends but I
pursue the vision that eludes me
I run across hills and dales I wander
through nameless lands because I am
hunting for the golden stag
You come and buy in the market
and go back to your homes laden with
goods but the spell of the homeless
winds has touched me I know not when
and where
I have no care in my heart all my
belongings I have left far behind me
I run across hills and dales I wander
through nameless lands--because I am
hunting for the golden stag
