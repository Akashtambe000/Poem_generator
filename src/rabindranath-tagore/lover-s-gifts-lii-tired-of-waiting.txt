Tired of waiting you burst your bonds impatient flowers before
the winter had gone Glimpses of the unseen comer reached your
wayside watch and you rushed out running and panting impulsive
jasmines troops of riotous roses
You were the first to march to the breach of death your
clamour of colour and perfume troubled the air You laughed and
pressed and pushed each other bared your breast and dropped in
heaps
The Summer will come in its time sailing in the flood-tide
of the south wind But you never counted slow moments to be sure
of him You recklessly spent your all in the road in the terrible
joy of faith
You heard his footsteps from afar and flung your mantle of
death for him to tread upon Your bonds break even before the
rescuer is seen you make him your own ere he can come and claim
you
