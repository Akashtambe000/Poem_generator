Day after day he comes and goes
away
Go and give him a flower from my
hair my friend
If he asks who was it that sent it I
entreat you do not tell him my name
for he only comes and goes away
He sits on the dust under the tree
Spread there a seat with flowers and
leaves my friend
His eyes are sad and they bring
sadness to my heart
He does not speak what he has in
mind he only comes and goes away
