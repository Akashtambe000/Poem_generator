Clouds rumbling in the sky teeming rain
I sit on the river bank sad and alone
The sheaves lie gathered harvest has ended
The river is swollen and fierce in its flow
As we cut the paddy it started to rain
One small paddy-field no one but me 
Flood-waters twisting and swirling everywhere
Trees on the far bank smear shadows like ink
On a village painted on deep morning grey
On this side a paddy-field no one but me
Who is this steering close to the shore
Singing I feel that she is someone I know
The sails are filled wide she gazes ahead
Waves break helplessly against the boat each side
I watch and feel I have seen her face before
Oh to what foreign land do you sail
Come to the bank and moor your boat for a while
Go where you want to give where you care to
But come to the bank a moment show your smile 
Take away my golden paddy when you sail
Take it take as much as you can load
Is there more No none I have put it aboard
My intense labour here by the river 
I have parted with it all layer upon layer
Now take me as well be kind take me aboard
No room no room the boat is too small
Loaded with my gold paddy the boat is full
Across the rain-sky clouds heave to and fro
On the bare river-bank I remain alone 
What had has gone the golden boat took all
