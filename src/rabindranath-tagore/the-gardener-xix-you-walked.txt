You walked by the riverside path
with the full pitcher upon your hip
Why did you swiftly turn your face
and peep at me through your fluttering
veil
That gleaming look from the dark
came upon me like a breeze that sends
a shiver through the rippling water
and sweeps away to the shadowy
shore
It came to me like the bird of the
evening that hurriedly flies across the
lampless room from the one open
window to the other and disappears
in the night
You are hidden as a star behind the
hills and I am a passer-by upon the
road
But why did you stop for a moment
and glance at my face through your
veil while you walked by the river
side path with the full pitcher upon
your hip
