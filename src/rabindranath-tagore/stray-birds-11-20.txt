11
SOME unseen fingers like idle breeze
are playing upon my heart the music of the ripples
12
'WHAT language is thine O sea?'
'The language of eternal question.'
'What language is thy answer O sky
'The language of eternal silence.'
13
LISTEN
my heart
to the whispers of the world
with which it makes love to you
14
THE mystery of creation
is like the darkness of night
it is great
Delusions of knowledge are like
the fog of the morning
15
DO not seat your love upon a precipice because it is high
16
I SIT at my window this morning
where the world like a passer-by stops for a moment
nods to me and goes
17
THESE little thoughts are the rustle of leaves
they have their whisper of
joy in my mind
18
WHAT you are you do not see
what you see is your shadow
19
MY wishes are fools they shout across thy songs my Master
Let me but listen
20
I CANNOT choose the best
The best chooses me
