It was mid-day when you went
away 
The sun was strong in the sky
I had done my work and sat alone
on my balcony when you went away
Fitful gusts came winnowing
through the smells of may distant
fields
The doves cooed tireless in the shade
and a bee strayed in my room hum
ming the news of many distant fields
The village slept in the noonday
heat The road lay deserted
In sudden fits the rustling of the
leaves rose and died
I gazed at the sky and wove in the
blue the letters of a name I had known
while the village slept in the noonday
heat
I had forgotten to braid my hair
The languid breeze played with it upon
my cheek
The river ran unruffled under the
shady bank
The lazy white clouds did not move
I had forgotten to braid my hair
It was mid-day when you went
away
The dust of the road was hot and
the fields panting
The doves cooed among the dense
leaves
I was alone in my balcony when you
went away
