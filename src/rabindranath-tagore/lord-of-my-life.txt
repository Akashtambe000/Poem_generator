Thou who art the innermost Spirit of my being
art thou pleased Lord of my Life
For I give to thee my cup filled with all
the pain and delight that the crushed
grapes of my heart had surrendered
I wove with rhythm of colors and song cover for thy bed
And with the molten gold of my desires
I fashioned playthings for thy passing hours
I know not why thou chosest me for thy partner
Lord of my life
Didst thou store my days and nights
my deeds and dreams for the alchemy of thy art
and string in the chain of thy music my songs of autumn and spring
and gather the flowers from my mature moments for thy crown
I see thine eyes gazing at the dark of my heart
Lord of my life
I wonder if my failure and wrongs are forgiven
For many were my days without service
and nights of forgetfulness futile were the flowers
that faded in the shade not offered to thee
Often the tied strings of my lute slackened
at the strains of thy tunes
And often at the ruin of wasted hours
my desolate evenings were filled with tears
But have my days come to their end at last
Lord of my life while my arms round thee
grow limp my kisses losing their truth
Then break up the meeting of this languid day
Renew the old in me in fresh forms of delight
and let the wedding come once again in
a new ceremony of life
