Free me from the bonds of your
sweetness my love Nor more of this
wine of kisses
This mist of heavy incense stifles
my heart
Open the doors make room for the
morning light
I am lost in you wrapped in the
folds of your caresses
Free me from your spells and give
me back the manhood to offer you my
freed heart
