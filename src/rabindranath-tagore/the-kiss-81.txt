Lips' language to lips' ears
Two drinking each other's heart it seems
Two roving loves who have left home
pilgrims to the confluence of lips
Two waves rise by the law of love
to break and die on two sets of lips
Two wild desires craving each other
meet at last at the body's limits
Love's writing a song in dainty letters
layers of kiss-calligraphy on lips
Plucking flowers from two sets of lips
perhaps to thread them into a chain later
This sweet union of lips
is the red marriage-bed of a pair of smiles
