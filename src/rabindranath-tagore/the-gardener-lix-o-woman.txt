O woman you are not merely the
handiwork of God but also of men
these are ever endowing you with
beauty from their hearts
Poets are weaving for you a web
with threads of golden imagery
painters are giving your form ever
new immortality
The sea gives its pearls the mines
their gold the summer gardens their
flowers to deck you to cover you to
make you more precious
The desire of men's hearts has shed
its glory over your youth
You are one half woman and one
half dream
