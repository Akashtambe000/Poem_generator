I shall gladly suffer the pride of culture to die out in my house
if only in some happy future I am born a herd-boy in the Brinda
forest
The herd-boy who grazes his cattle sitting under the banyan
tree and idly weaves gunja flowers into garlands who loves to
splash and plunge in the Jamuna's cool deep stream
He calls his companions to wake up when morning dawns and all
the houses in the lane hum with the sound of the churn clouds of
dust are raised by the cattle the maidens come out in the
courtyard to milk the king
As the shadows deepen under the tomal trees and the dusk
gathers on the river-banks when the milkmaids while crossing the
turbulent water tremble with fear and loud peacocks with tails
outspread dance in the forest he watchers the summer clouds
When the April night is sweet as a fresh-blown flower he
disappears in the forest with a peacock's plume in his hair the
swing ropes are twined with flowers on the branches the south wind
throbs with music and the merry shepherd boys crowd on the banks
of the blue river
No I will never be the leader brothers of this new age of
new Bengal I shall not trouble to light the lamp of culture for
the benighted If only I could be born under the shady asoka
groves in some village of Brinda where milk is churned by the
maidens
