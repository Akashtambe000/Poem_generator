When she passed by me with quick
steps the end of her skirt touched
me
From the unknown island of a
heart came a sudden warm breath of
spring
A flutter of a flitting touch brushed
me and vanished in a moment like a
torn flower petal blown in the breeze
It fell upon my heart like a sigh of
her body and whisper of her heart
