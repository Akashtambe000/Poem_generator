Your questioning eyes are sad They
seek to know my meaning as the moon
would fathom the sea
I have bared my life before your
eyes from end to end with nothing
hidden or held back That is why you
know me not
If it were only a gem I could break
it into a hundred pieces and string
them into a chain to put on your neck
If it were only a flower round and
small and sweet I could pluck it from
its stem to set it in your hair
But it is a heart my beloved
Where are its shores and its bottom
You know not the limits of this
kingdom still you are its queen
If it were only a moment of pleasure
it would flower in an easy smile and
you could see it and read it in a
moment
If it were merely a pain it would
melt in limpid tears reflecting its
inmost secret without a word
But it is love my beloved
Its pleasure and pain are boundless
and endless its wants and wealth
It is as near to you as your life but
you can never wholly know it
