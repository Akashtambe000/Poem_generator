You left me and went on your way
I thought I should mourn for you
and set your solitary image in my
heart wrought in a golden song
But ah my evil fortune time is
short
Youth wanes year after year the
spring days are fugitive the frail
flowers die for nothing and the wise
man warns me that life is but a
dewdrop on the lotus leaf
Should I neglect all this to gaze after
one who has turned her back on me
That would be rude and foolish
for time is short
Then come my rainy nights with
pattering feet smile my golden
autumn come careless April scatter
ing your kisses abroad
You come and you and you also
My loves you know we are mortals
Is it wise to break one's heart for the
one who takes her heart away For
time is short
It is sweet to sit in a corner to muse
and write in rhymes that you are all
my world
It is heroic to hug one's sorrow and
determine not to be consoled
But a fresh face peeps across my
door and raise its eyes to my eyes
I cannot but wipe away my tears
and change the tune of my song
For time is short
