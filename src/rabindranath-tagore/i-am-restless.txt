I am restless I am athirst for far-away things
My soul goes out in a longing to touch the skirt of the dim distance
O Great Beyond O the keen call of thy flute
I forget I ever forget that I have no wings to fly that I am bound in this spot evermore
I am eager and wakeful I am a stranger in a strange land
Thy breath comes to me whispering an impossible hope
Thy tongue is known to my heart as its very own
O Far-to-seek O the keen call of thy flute
I forget I ever forget that I know not the way that I have not the winged horse
I am listless I am a wanderer in my heart
In the sunny haze of the languid hours what vast vision of thine takes shape in the blue of the sky
O Farthest end O the keen call of thy flute
I forget I ever forget that the gates are shut everywhere in the house where I dwell alone
