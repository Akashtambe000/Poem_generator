21
THEY throw their shadows before them
who carry their lantern on their back
22
THAT I exist
is a perpetual surprise
which is life
23
'WE the rustling leaves
have a voice that answers the storms
but who are you so silent?'
'I am a mere flower.'
24
REST belongs to the work
as the eyelids to the eyes
25
MAN is a born child
his power is the power of growth
26
GOD expects answers for the flowers he sends us
not for the sun
and the earth
27
THE light that plays like a naked child
among the green leaves happily knows not
that man can lie
28
O BEAUTY
find thyself in love
not in the flattery of thy mirror
29
MY heart beats her waves at the shore of the world
and writes upon it her signature in tears with the words
'I love thee.'

30
'MOON
for what do you wait?'
'To salute the sun for whom I must make way.'
