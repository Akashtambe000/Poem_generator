"Where have I come from where did you pick me up?" the baby asked
its mother
She answered half crying half laughing and clasping the
baby to her breast
"You were hidden in my heart as its desire my darling
You were in the dolls of my childhood's games and when with
clay I made the image of my god every morning I made the unmade
you then
You were enshrined with our household deity in his worship
I worshipped you
In all my hopes and my loves in my life in the life of my
mother you have lived
In the lap of the deathless Spirit who rules our home you have
been nursed for ages
When in girlhood my heart was opening its petals you hovered
as a fragrance about it
Your tender softness bloomed in my youthful limbs like a glow
in the sky before the sunrise
Heaven's first darling twain-born with the morning light you
have floated down the stream of the world's life and at last you
have stranded on my heart
As I gaze on your face mystery overwhelms me you who belong
to all have become mine
For fear of losing you I hold you tight to my breast What
magic has snared the world's treasure in these slender arms of
mine?"
