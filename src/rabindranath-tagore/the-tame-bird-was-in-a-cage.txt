THE tame bird was in a cage the free bird was in the forest
They met when the time came it was a decree of fate
The free bird cries 'O my love let us fly to the wood.'
The cage bird whispers 'Come hither let us both live in the cage.'
Says the free bird 'Among bars where is there room to spread one's wings?'
'Alas,' cries the caged bird 'I should not know where to sit perched in the sky.'
The free bird cries 'My darling sing the songs of the woodlands.'
The cage bird sings 'Sit by my side I'll teach you the speech of the learned.'
The forest bird cries 'No ah no songs can never be taught.'
The cage bird says 'Alas for me I know not the songs of the woodlands.'
There love is intense with longing but they never can fly wing to wing
Through the bars of the cage they look and vain is their wish to know each other
They flutter their wings in yearning and sing 'Come closer my love!'
The free bird cries 'It cannot be I fear the closed doors of the cage.'
The cage bird whispers 'Alas my wings are powerless and dead.'
