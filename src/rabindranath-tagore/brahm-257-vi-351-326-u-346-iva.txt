I THE DARK
In a worldless timeless lightless great emptiness
Four-faced Brahma broods
nasad asin no sad asit tadanim
nasid raja no vioma paro yat
kim avarivah kuha kasya sarmann
Ambhah kim asid gahanam gabhiram
na mytur asid amrtam na tarhi
na ratria ahna asit pratekh
anid avatam svadhaya tad ekam
tasmad dhanyan na parah kim canasa
tama asit tamasa gudham agre
apraketam salilam sarvam a idam
tuchyenabhu apihitam yad asit
tapasas tan mahinajayataikam
Of a sudden sea of joy surges through his heart –
The ur-god opens his eyes
Speech from four mouths
Speeds from each quarter
Through infinite dark
Through limitless sky
Like a growing sea-storm
Like hope never sated
His Word starts to move
Stirred by joy his breathing quickens
His eight eyes quiver with flame
His fire-matted hair sweeps the horizon
Bright as a million suns
From the towering source of the world
In a thousand streams
Cascades the primeval blazing fountain
Fragmenting silence
Splitting its stone heart
kamas tad agre sam avartatadhi
manaso retah prathamam yad asit
sato bandhum asati nir avindan
hrdi pratisya kavayo manisa
II THE MUSIC
In a universe rampant
With new life exhalant
With new life exultant
Vishnu spreads wide
His four-handed blessing
He raises his conch
And all things quake
At its booming sound
The frenzy dies down
The furnace expires
The planets douse
Their flames with tears
The world’s Divine Poet
Constructs its history
From wild cosmic song
Its epic is formed
Stars in their orbits
Moon sun and planets –
He binds with his mace
All things to Law
Imposes the discipline
Of metre and rhyme
In the Manasa depths
Vishnu watches 
Beauties arise
From the light of lotuses
Lakshmi strews smiles 
Clouds show a rainbow
Gardens show flowers
The roar of Creation
Resolves into music
Softness hides rigour
Forms cover power
tirascino vitato rasmir esam
adhah svid asid upari svid asit
retodha asan mahimana asan
svadha avasat prayatih parastat
Age after age after age is slave to a mighty rhythm –
At last the world-frame
Tires in its body
Sleep in its eyes
Slackens its structure
Diffuses its energy
From the heart of all matter
Comes the anguished cry –
‘Wake wake great Shiva
Our body grows weary
Of its law-fixed path
Give us new form
Sing our destruction
That we gain new life.’
III THE FIRE
The great god awakes
His three eyes open
He surveys all horizons
He lifts his bow his fell pinaka
He pounds the world with his tread
From first things to last it trembles and shakes
And shudders
The bonds of nature are ripped
The sky is rocked by the roar
Of a wave of ecstatic release
An inferno soars –
The pyre of the universe
Shattered sun and moon smashed stars and planets
Rain down from all angles
A blackness of all particles
To be swallowed by flame
Absorbed in an instant
At the start of Creation
There was a dark without origin
At the breaking of Creation
There is fire without end
In an all-pervading sky-engulfing sea of burning
Shiva shuts his three eyes
He begins his great trance
ko adha veda Ka iha pravocat
kuta ajata kuta iyam visrstih
arvag deva asya visajanena
atha ko veda yata ababhuva
iyam visrstir yata ababhuva
yadi vasa dadhe yadi van na
yo asyadhyaksah parame vioman
so anga veda yadi va na veda
