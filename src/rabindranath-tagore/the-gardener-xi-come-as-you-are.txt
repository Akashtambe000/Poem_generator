Come as you are do not loiter over
your toilet
If your braided hair has loosened if
the parting of your hair be not straight
if the ribbons of your bodice be not
fastened do not mind
Come as you are do not loiter over
your toilet
Come with quick steps over the
grass
If the raddle come from your feet
because of the dew of the rings of bells
upon your feet slacken if pearls drop
out of your chain do not mind
Come with quick steps over the
grass
Do you see the clouds wrapping the
sky
Flocks of cranes fly up from the
further river-bank and fitful gusts of
wind rush over the heath
The anxious cattle run to their stalls
in the village
Do you see the clouds wrapping the
sky
In vain you light your toilet lamp
it flickers and goes out in the
wind
Who can know that your eyelids
have not been touched with lamp
black For your eyes are darker
than rain-clouds
In vain you light your toilet lamp
it goes out
Come as you are do not loiter over
your toilet
If the wreath is not woven who
cares if the wrist-chain had not been
linked let it be
The sky is overcast with clouds--it
is late
Come as you are do not loiter over
your toilet
