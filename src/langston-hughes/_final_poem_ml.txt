I’m all alone in this world she said
Ain’t got nobody to share my bed
Ain’t got nobody to hold my hand
The truth of the matter’s
I ain’t got no man
Big Boy opened his mouth and said
Trouble with you is
You ain’t got no head
If you had a head and used your mind
You could have me with you
All the time
She answered Babe what must I do
He said Share your bed
And your money too
God in His infinite wisdom
Did not make me very wise
So when my actions are stupid
They hardly take God by surprise
Fine living a la carte

Have luncheon there this afternoon all you jobless
Why not
Dine with some of the men and women who got rich off of
your labor who clip coupons with clean white fingers
because your hands dug coal drilled stone sewed gar
ments poured steel to let other people draw dividends
and live easy
Or havent you had enough yet of the souplines and the bit
ter bread of charity
Walk through Peacock Alley tonight before dinner and get
warm anyway Youve got nothing else to do
Let the rain kiss you
Let the rain beat upon your head with silver liquid drops
Let the rain sing you a lullaby
The rain makes still pools on the sidewalk
The rain makes running pools in the gutter
The rain plays a little sleep song on our roof at night
And I love the rain
I would liken you
To a night without stars
Were it not for your eyes
I would liken you
To a sleep without dreams
Were it not for your songs
It was a long time ago
I have almost forgotten my dream
But it was there then
In front of me
Bright like a sun
My dream
And then the wall rose
Rose slowly
Slowly
Between me and my dream
Rose until it touched the sky
The wall
Shadow
I am black
I lie down in the shadow
No longer the light of my dream before me
Above me
Only the thick wall
Only the shadow
My hands
My dark hands
Break through the wall
Find my dream
Help me to shatter this darkness
To smash this night
To break this shadow
Into a thousand lights of sun
Into a thousand whirling dreams
Of sun
Here I sit
With my shoes mismated
Lawdymercy
Is frustrated
Goin’ down the road Lawd
Goin’ down the road
Down the road Lawd
Wayway down the road
Got to find somebody
To help me carry this load
Road’s in front o’ me
Nothin’ to do but walk
Road’s in front of me
Walk…an’ walk…an’ walk
I’d like to meet a good friend
To come along an’ talk
Hates to be lonely
Lawd I hates to be sad
Says I hates to be lonely
Hates to be lonely an’ sad
But ever friend you finds seems
Like they try to do you bad
Road road road O
Road road…road…road road
Road road road O
On the no’thern road
These Mississippi towns ain’t
Fit fer a hoppin’ toad
Gather quickly
Out of darkness
All the songs you know
And throw them at the sun
Before they melt
Like snow
Clean the spittoons boy
Detroit
Chicago
Atlantic City
Palm Beach
Clean the spittoons
The steam in hotel kitchens
And the smoke in hotel lobbies
And the slime in hotel spittoons
Part of my life
Hey boy
A nickel
A dime
A dollar
Two dollars a day
Hey boy
A nickel
A dime
A dollar
Two dollars
Buy shoes for the baby
House rent to pay
Gin on Saturday
Church on Sunday
My God
Babies and gin and church
And women and Sunday
All mixed with dimes and
Dollars and clean spittoons
And house rent to pay
Hey boy
A bright bowl of brass is beautiful to the Lord
Bright polished brass like the cymbals
Of King David’s dancers
Like the wine cups of Solomon
Hey boy
A clean spittoon on the altar of the Lord
A clean bright spittoon all newly polished
At least I can offer that
Com’mere boy
Big Boy came
Carrying a mermaid
On his shoulders
And the mermaid
Had her tail
Curved
Beneath his arm
Being a fisher boy
He’d found a fish
To carry
Half fish
Half girl
To marry
By what sends
the white kids
I aint sent
I know I cant
be President
What dont bug
them white kids
sure bugs me
We know everybody
aint free
Lies written down
for white folks
aint for us atall
Liberty And Justice
HuhFor All
My old mans a white old man
And my old mothers black
If ever I cursed my white old man
I take my curses back
If ever I cursed my black old mother
And wished she were in hell
Im sorry for that evil wish
And now I wish her well
My old man died in a fine big house
My ma died in a shack
I wonder where Im going to die
Being neither white nor black
In the Quarter of the Negroes
Where the doors are doors of paper
Dust of dingy atoms
Blows a scratchy sound
Amorphous jackoLanterns caper
And the wind wont wait for midnight
For fun to blow doors down
By the river and the railroad
With fluid faroff goind
Boundaries bind unbinding
A whirl of whisteles blowing
No trains or steamboats going
Yet Leontynes unpacking
In the Quarter of the Negroes
Where the doorknob lets in Lieder
More than German ever bore
Her yesterday past grandpa
Not of her own doing
In a pot of collard greens
Is gently stewing
Pushcarts fold and unfold
In a supermarket sea
And we better find out mama
Where is the colored laundromat
Since we move dup to Mount Vernon
In the pot begind the paper doors
on the old iron stove whats cooking
Whats smelling Leontyne
Lieder lovely Lieder
And a leaf of collard green
Lovely Lieder Leontyne
You know right at Christmas
They asked me if my blackness
Would it rub off
I said Ask your mama
Dreams and nightmares
Nightmares dreams oh
Dreaming that the Negroes
Of the South have taken over
Voted all the Dixiecrats
Right out of power
Comes the COLORED HOUR
Martin Luther King is Governor of Georgia
Dr Rufus Clement his Chief Adviser
A Philip Randolph the High Grand Worthy
In white pillared mansions
Sitting on their wide verandas
Wealthy Negroes have white servants
White sharecroppers work the black plantations
And colored children have white mammies
Mammy Faubus
Mammy Eastland
Mammy Wallace
Dear dear darling old white mammies
Sometimes even buried with our family
Dear old
Mammy Faubus
Culture they say is a twoway street
Hand me my mint julep mammny
Hurry up
Make haste
When I get to be a composer
Im gonna write me some music about
Daybreak in Alabama
And Im gonna put the purtiest songs in it
Rising out of the ground like a swamp mist
And falling out of heaven like soft dew
Im gonna put some tall tall trees in it
And the scent of pine needles
And the smell of red clay after rain
And long red necks
And poppy colored faces
And big brown arms
And the field daisy eyes
Of black and white black white black people
And Im gonna put white hands
And black hands and brown and yellow hands
And red clay earth hands in it
Touching everybody with kind fingers
And touching each other natural as dew
In that dawn of music when I
Get to be a composer
And write about daybreak
In Alabama
Harlem
Sent him home
in a long box
Too dead
To know why
The licker
Was lye
Listen
Dear dream of utter aliveness
Touching my body of utter death
Tell me O quickly dream of aliveness
The flaming source of your bright breath
Tell me O dream of utter aliveness
Knowing so well the wind and the sun
Where is this light
Your eyes see forever
And what is the wind
You touch when you run
Democracy will not come
Today this year
Nor ever
Through compromise and fear
I have as much right
As the other fellow has
To stand
On my two feet
And own the land
I tire so of hearing people say
Let things take their course
Tomorrow is another day
I do not need my freedom when Im dead
I cannot live on tomorrows bread
Freedom
Is a strong seed
Planted
In a great need
I live here too
I want freedom
Just as you
I know I am
The Negro Problem
Being wined and dined
Answering the usual questions
That come to white mind
Which seeks demurely
To Probe in polite way
The why and wherewithal
Of darkness USA
Wondering how things got this way
In current democratic night
Murmuring gently
Over fraises du bois
Im so ashamed of being white
The lobster is delicious
The wine divine
And center of attention
At the damask table mine
To be a Problem on
Park Avenue at eight
Is not so bad
Solutions to the Problem
Of course wait
Good morning daddy
Aint you heard
The boogiewoogie rumble
Of a dream deferred
Listen closely
Youll hear their feet
Beating out and beating out a
You think
Its a happy beat
Listen to it closely
Aint you heard
something underneath
like a
What did I say
Sure
Im happy
Take it away
Hey pop
Rebop
Mop
Yeah
What happens to a dream deferred
Does it dry up
Like a raisin in the sun
Or fester like a sore
And then run
Does it stink like rotten meat
Or crust and sugar over
like a syrupy sweet
Maybe it just sags
like a heavy load
Or does it explode
To fling my arms wide
In some place of the sun
To whirl and to dance
Till the white day is done
Then rest at cool evening
Beneath a tall tree
While night comes on gently
Dark like me
That is my dream
To fling my arms wide
In the face of the sun
Dance Whirl Whirl
Till the quick day is done
Rest at pale evening
A tall slim tree
Night coming tenderly
Black like me
Hold fast to dreams
For if dreams die
Life is a brokenwinged bird
That cannot fly
Hold fast to dreams
For when dreams go
Life is a barren field
Frozen with snow
Sensing death
The buzzards gather
Noting the last struggle
Of flesh under weather
Noting the last glance
Of agonized eye
At passing wind
And boundless sky
Down in the bass
That steady beat
Walking walking walking
Like marching feet
Down in the bass
They easy roll
Rolling like I like it
In my soul
Riffs smears breaks
Hey Lawdy Mama
Do you hear what I said
Easy like I rock it
In my bed
It would be nice
In any case
To someday meet you
Face to face
Walking down
The road to hell
As I come up
Feeling swell
Its such a
Bore
Being always
Poor
At the feet o Jesus
Sorrow like a sea
Lordy let yo mercy
Come driftin down on me
At the feet o Jesus
At yo feet I stand
O ma little Jesus
Please reach out yo hand
When you turn the corner
And you run into yourself
Then you know that you have turned
All the corners that are left
The gold moth did not love him
So gorgeous she flew away
But the gray moth circled the flame
Until the break of day
And then with wings like a dead desire
She fell firecaught into the flame
In places like
Selma Alabama
Kids say
In places like
Chicago and New York
In places like
Chicago and New York
Kids say
In places like
London and Paris
In places like
London and Paris
Kids say
In places like
Chicago and New York
When a man starts out with nothing
When a man starts out with his hands
Empty but clean
When a man starts to build a world
He starts first with himself
And the faith that is in his heart
The strength there
The will there to build
First in the heart is the dream
Then the mind starts seeking a way
His eyes look out on the world
On the great wooded world
On the rich soil of the world
On the rivers of the world
The eyes see there materials for building
See the difficulties too and the obstacles
The mind seeks a way to overcome these obstacles
The hand seeks tools to cut the wood
To till the soil and harness the power of the waters
Then the hand seeks other hands to help
A community of hands to help
Thus the dream becomes not one man’s dream alone
But a community dream
Not my dream alone but our dream
Not my world alone
But your world and my world
Belonging to all the hands who build
A long time ago but not too long ago
Ships came from across the sea
Bringing the Pilgrims and prayermakers
Adventurers and booty seekers
Free men and indentured servants
Slave men and slave masters all new
To a new world America
With billowing sails the galleons came
Bringing men and dreams women and dreams
In little bands together
Heart reaching out to heart
Hand reaching out to hand
They began to build our land
Some were free hands
Seeking a greater freedom
Some were indentured hands
Hoping to find their freedom
Some were slave hands
Guarding in their hearts the seed of freedom
But the word was there always
Freedom
Down into the earth went the plow
In the free hands and the slave hands
In indentured hands and adventurous hands
Turning the rich soil went the plow in many hands
That planted and harvested the food that fed
And the cotton that clothed America
Clang against the trees went the ax into many hands
That hewed and shaped the rooftops of America
Splash into the rivers and the seas went the boathulls
That moved and transported America
Crack went the whips that drove the horses
Across the plains of America
Free hands and slave hands
Indentured hands adventurous hands
White hands and black hands
Held the plow handles
Ax handles hammer handles
Launched the boats and whipped the horses
That fed and housed and moved America
Thus together through labor
All these hands made America
Labor Out of labor came villages
And the towns that grew cities
Labor Out of labor came the rowboats
And the sailboats and the steamboats
Came the wagons and the coaches
Covered wagons stage coaches
Out of labor came the factories
Came the foundries came the railroads
Came the marts and markets shops and stores
Came the mighty products moulded manufactured
Sold in shops piled in warehouses
Shipped the wide world over
Out of laborwhite hands and black hands
Came the dream the strength the will
And the way to build America
Now it is Me here and You there
Now it’s Manhattan Chicago
Seattle New Orleans
Boston and El Paso
Now it’s the USA
A long time ago but not too long ago a man said
ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL
ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR
WITH CERTAIN UNALIENABLE RIGHTS
AMONG THESE LIFE LIBERTY
AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS
His name was Jefferson There were slaves then
But in their hearts the slaves believed him too
And silently took for granted
That what he said was also meant for them
It was a long time ago
But not so long ago at that Lincoln said
NO MAN IS GOOD ENOUGH
TO GOVERN ANOTHER MAN
WITHOUT THAT OTHER’S CONSENT
There were slaves then too
But in their hearts the slaves knew
What he said must be meant for every human being
Else it had no meaning for anyone
Then a man said
BETTER TO DIE FREE
THAN TO LIVE SLAVES
He was a colored man who had been a slave
But had run away to freedom
And the slaves knew
What Frederick Douglass said was true
With John Brown at Harper’s Ferry Negroes died
John Brown was hung
Before the Civil War days were dark
And nobody knew for sure
When freedom would triumph
Or if it would thought some
But others new it had to triumph
In those dark days of slavery
Guarding in their hearts the seed of freedom
The slaves made up a song
Keep Your Hand On The Plow Hold On
That song meant just what it said Hold On
Freedom will come
Keep Your Hand On The Plow Hold On
Out of war it came bloody and terrible
But it came
Some there were as always
Who doubted that the war would end right
That the slaves would be free
Or that the union would stand
But now we know how it all came out
Out of the darkest days for people and a nation
We know now how it came out
There was light when the battle clouds rolled away
There was a great wooded land
And men united as a nation
America is a dream
The poet says it was promises
The people say it is promisesthat will come true
The people do not always say things out loud
Nor write them down on paper
The people often hold
Great thoughts in their deepest hearts
And sometimes only blunderingly express them
Haltingly and stumblingly say them
And faultily put them into practice
The people do not always understand each other
But there is somewhere there
Always the trying to understand
And the trying to say
You are a man Together we are building our land
America
Land created in common
Dream nourished in common
Keep your hand on the plow Hold on
If the house is not yet finished
Don’t be discouraged builder
If the fight is not yet won
Don’t be weary soldier
The plan and the pattern is here
Woven from the beginning
Into the warp and woof of America
ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL
NO MAN IS GOOD ENOUGH
TO GOVERN ANOTHER MAN
WITHOUT HIS CONSENT
BETTER DIE FREE
THAN TO LIVE SLAVES
Who said those things Americans
Who owns those words America
Who is America You me
We are America
To the enemy who would conquer us from without
We say NO
To the enemy who would divide
And conquer us from within
We say NO
FREEDOM
BROTHERHOOD
DEMOCRACY
To all the enemies of these great words
We say NO
A long time ago
An enslaved people heading toward freedom
Made up a song
Keep Your Hand On The Plow Hold On
The plow plowed a new furrow
Across the field of history
Into that furrow the freedom seed was dropped
From that seed a tree grew is growing will ever grow
That tree is for everybody
For all America for all the world
May its branches spread and shelter grow
Until all races and all peoples know its shade
KEEP YOUR HAND ON THE PLOW HOLD ON
This is a song for the genius child
Sing it softly for the song is wild
Sing it softly as ever you can
Lest the song get out of hand
iNobody loves a genius child/i
Can you love an eagle
Tame or wild
Can you love an eagle
Wild or tame
Can you love a monster
Of frightening name
iNobody loves a genius child/i
iKill him/i and let his soul run wild
I am God
Without one friend
Alone in my purity
World without end
Below me young lovers
Tread the sweet ground
But I am God
I cannot come down
Spring
Life is love
Love is life only
Better to be human
Than Godand lonely
The ivory gods
And the ebony gods
And the gods of diamond and jade
Sit silently on their temple shelves
While the people
Are afraid
Yet the ivory gods
And the ebony gods
And the gods of diamondjade
Are only silly puppet gods
That the people themselves
Have made
What happens to a dream deferred
Does it dry up
like a raisin in the sun
Or fester like a sore
And then run
Does it stink like rotten meat
Or crust and sugar over
like a syrupy sweet
Maybe it just sags
like a heavy load
Or does it explode
She
In the dark
Found light
Brighter than many ever see
She
Within herself
Found loveliness
Through the souls own mastery
And now the world receives
From her dower
The message of the strength
Of inner power
I take my dreams and make of them a bronze vase
and a round fountain with a beautiful statue in its center
And a song with a broken heart and I ask you
Do you understand my dreams
Sometimes you say you do
And sometimes you say you dont
Either way it doesnt matter
I continue to dream
I dream a world where man
No other man will scorn
Where love will bless the earth
And peace its paths adorn
I dream a world where all
Will know sweet freedoms way
Where greed no longer saps the soul
Nor avarice blights our day
A world I dream where black or white
Whatever race you be
Will share the bounties of the earth
And every man is free
Where wretchedness will hang its head
And joy like a pearl
Attends the needs of all mankind
Of such I dream my world
I too sing America
I am the darker brother
They send me to eat in the kitchen
When company comes
But I laugh
And eat well
And grow strong
Tomorrow
Ill be at the table
When company comes
Nobodyll dare
Say to me
Eat in the kitchen
Then
Besides
Theyll see how beautiful I am
And be ashamed
I too am America
In time of silver rain
The earth puts forth new life again
Green grasses grow
And flowers lift their heads
And over all the plain
The wonder spreads
Of Life
Of Life
Of life
In time of silver rain
The butterflies lift silken wings
To catch a rainbow cry
And trees put forth new leaves to sing
In joy beneath the sky
As down the roadway
Passing boys and girls
Go singing too
In time of silver rain When spring
And life
Are new
Oh silver tree
Oh shining rivers of the soul
In a Harlem cabaret
Six longheaded jazzers play
A dancing girl whose eyes are bold
Lifts high a dress of silken gold
Oh singing tree
Oh shining rivers of the soul
Were Eves eyes
In the first garden
Just a bit too bold
Was Cleopatra gorgeous
In a gown of gold
Oh shining tree
Oh silver rivers of the soul
In a whirling cabaret
Six longheaded jazzers play
I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you
Take the neon lights and make a crown
Take the Lenox Avenue busses
Taxis subways
And for your love song tone their rumble down
Take Harlems heartbeat
Make a drumbeat
Put it on a record let it whirl
And while we listen to it play
Dance with you till day
Dance with you my sweet brown Harlem girl
That Justice is a blind goddess
Is a thing to which we black are wise
Her bandage hides two festering sores
That once perhaps were eyes
This is for the kids who die
Black and white
For kids will die certainly
The old and rich will live on awhile
As always
Eating blood and gold
Letting kids die
Kids will die in the swamps of Mississippi
Organizing sharecroppers
Kids will die in the streets of Chicago
Organizing workers
Kids will die in the orange groves of California
Telling others to get together
Whites and Filipinos
Negroes and Mexicans
All kinds of kids will die
Who dont believe in lies and bribes and contentment
And a lousy peace
Of course the wise and the learned
Who pen editorials in the papers
And the gentlemen with Dr in front of their names
White and black
Who make surveys and write books
Will live on weaving words to smother the kids who die
And the sleazy courts
And the bribereaching police
And the bloodloving generals
And the moneyloving preachers
Will all raise their hands against the kids who die
Beating them with laws and clubs and bayonets and bullets
To frighten the people
For the kids who die are like iron in the blood of the people
And the old and rich dont want the people
To taste the iron of the kids who die
Dont want the people to get wise to their own power
To believe an Angelo Herndon or even get together
Listen kids who die
Maybe now there will be no monument for you
Except in our hearts
Maybe your bodiesll be lost in a swamp
Or a prison grave or the potters field
Or the rivers where youre drowned like Leibknecht
But the day will come
You are sure yourselves that it is coming
When the marching feet of the masses
Will raise for you a living monument of love
And joy and laughter
And black hands and white hands clasped as one
And a song that reaches the sky
The song of the life triumphant
Through the kids who die
Let America be America again
Let it be the dream it used to be
Let it be the pioneer on the plain
Seeking a home where he himself is free
America never was America to me
Let America be the dream the dreamers dreamed
Let it be that great strong land of love
Where never kings connive nor tyrants scheme
That any man be crushed by one above
It never was America to me
O let my land be a land where Liberty
Is crowned with no false patriotic wreath
But opportunity is real and life is free
Equality is in the air we breathe
Theres never been equality for me
Nor freedom in this homeland of the free
Say who are you that mumbles in the dark
And who are you that draws your veil across the stars
I am the poor white fooled and pushed apart
I am the Negro bearing slaverys scars
I am the red man driven from the land
I am the immigrant clutching the hope I seek
And finding only the same old stupid plan
Of dog eat dog of mighty crush the weak
I am the young man full of strength and hope
Tangled in that ancient endless chain
Of profit power gain of grab the land
Of grab the gold Of grab the ways of satisfying need
Of work the men Of take the pay
Of owning everything for ones own greed
I am the farmer bondsman to the soil
I am the worker sold to the machine
I am the Negro servant to you all
I am the people humble hungry mean
Hungry yet today despite the dream
Beaten yet todayO Pioneers
I am the man who never got ahead
The poorest worker bartered through the years
Yet Im the one who dreamt our basic dream
In the Old World while still a serf of kings
Who dreamt a dream so strong so brave so true
That even yet its mighty daring sings
In every brick and stone in every furrow turned
Thats made America the land it has become
O Im the man who sailed those early seas
In search of what I meant to be my home
For Im the one who left dark Irelands shore
And Polands plain and Englands grassy lea
And torn from Black Africas strand I came
To build a homeland of the free
The free
Who said the free Not me
Surely not me The millions on relief today
The millions shot down when we strike
The millions who have nothing for our pay
For all the dreams weve dreamed
And all the songs weve sung
And all the hopes weve held
And all the flags weve hung
The millions who have nothing for our pay
Except the dream thats almost dead today
O let America be America again
The land that never has been yet
And yet must bethe land where every man is free
The land thats minethe poor mans Indians Negros ME
Who made America
Whose sweat and blood whose faith and pain
Whose hand at the foundry whose plow in the rain
Must bring back our mighty dream again
Sure call me any ugly name you choose
The steel of freedom does not stain
From those who live like leeches on the peoples lives
We must take back our land again
America
O yes
I say it plain
America never was America to me
And yet I swear this oath
America will be
Out of the rack and ruin of our gangster death
The rape and rot of graft and stealth and lies
We the people must redeem
The land the mines the plants the rivers
The mountains and the endless plain
All all the stretch of these great green states
And make America again
I went down to the river
I set down on the bank
I tried to think but couldnt
So I jumped in and sank
I came up once and hollered
I came up twice and cried
If that water hadnt abeen so cold
I mightve sunk and died
But it was Cold in that water It was cold
I took the elevator
Sixteen floors above the ground
I thought about my baby
And thought I would jump down
I stood there and I hollered
I stood there and I cried
If it hadnt abeen so high
I mightve jumped and died
But it was High up there It was high
So since Im still here livin
I guess I will live on
I couldve died for love
But for livin I was born
Though you may hear me holler
And you may see me cry
Ill be dogged sweet baby
If you gonna see me die
Life is fine Fine as wine Life is fine
Lets go see Old Abe
Sitting in the marble and the moonlight
Sitting lonely in the marble and the moonlight
Quiet for ten thousand centuries old Abe
Quiet for a million million years
Quiet
And yet a voice forever
Against the
Timeless walls
Of time
Old Abe
I got to leave this town
It’s a lonesome place
Got to leave this town cause
It’s a lonesome place
A po’ po’ boy can’t
Find a friendly face
Goin’ down to de river
Flowin’ deep an’ slow
Goin’ down to de river
Deep an’ slow
Cause there ain’t no worries
Where de waters go
I’m weary weary
Weary as I can be
Weary weary
Weary as can be
This life’s so weary
‘S’ bout to overcome me
Love
Is a ripe plum
Growing on a purple tree
Taste it once
And the spell of its enchantment
Will never let you be
Love
Is a bright star
Glowing in far Southern skies
Look too hard
And its burning flame
Will always hurt your eyes
Love
Is a high mountain
Stark in a windy sky
If you
Would never lose your breath
Do not climb too high
I worked for a woman
She wasnt mean
But she had a twelveroom
House to clean
Had to get breakfast
Dinner and supper too
Then take care of her children
When I got through
Wash iron and scrub
Walk the dog around
It was too much
Nearly broke me down
I said Madam
Can it be
You trying to make a
Packhorse out of me
She opened her mouth
She cried Oh no
You know Alberta
I love you so
I said Madam
That may be true
But Ill be dogged
If I love you
The census man
The day he came round
Wanted my name
To put it down
I said Johnson
Alberta K
But he hated to write
The K that way
He said What
Does K stand for
I said K
And nothing more
He said Im gonna put it
KÐAÐY
I said If you do
You lie
My mother christened me
Alberta K
You leave my name
Just that way
He said Mrs
With a snort
Just a K

And splinters
And boards torn up
And places with no carpet on the floor
Bare
But all the time
Ise been aclimbin on
And reachin landins
And turnin corners
And sometimes goin in the dark
Where there aint been no light
So boy dont you turn back
Dont you set down on the steps
Cause you finds its kinder hard
Dont you fall now
For Ise still goin honey
Ise still climbin
And life for me aint been no crystal stair
I play it cool
I dig all jive
Thats the reason
I stay alive
My motto
As I live and learn
Is dig and be dug in return
The night is beautiful
So the faces of my people
The stars are beautiful
So the eyes of my people
Beautiful also is the sun
Beautiful also are the souls of my people
Me an ma babys

Soft light on the tables
Music gay
Brownskin steppers
In a cabaret
White folks laugh
White folks pray
Me an ma babys
Got two mo ways
Two mo ways to do de

Ive known rivers
Ive known rivers ancient as the world and older than the
flow of human blood in human veins
My soul has grown deep like the rivers
I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young
I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep
I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it
I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln
went down to New Orleans and Ive seen its muddy
bosom turn all golden in the sunset
Ive known rivers
Ancient dusky rivers
My soul has grown deep like the rivers
Night funeral
In Harlem
Where did they get
Them two fine cars
Insurance man he did not pay
His insurance lapsed the other day
Yet they got a satin box
for his head to lay
Night funeral
In Harlem
Who was it sent
That wreath of flowers
Them flowers came
from that poor boys friends
Theyll want flowers too
When they meet their ends
Night funeral
in Harlem
Who preached that
Black boy to his grave
Old preacher man
Preached that boy away
Charged Five Dollars
His girl friend had to pay
Night funeral
In Harlem
When it was all over
And the lid shut on his head
and the organ had done played
and the last prayers been said
and six pallbearers
Carried him out for dead
And off down Lenox Avenue
That long black hearse done sped
The street light
At his corner
Shined just like a tear
That boy that they was mournin
Was so dear so dear
To them folks that brought the flowers
To that girl who paid the preacher man
It was all their tears that made
That poor boys
Funeral grand
Night funeral
In Harlem
Now dreams
Are not available
To the dreamers
Nor songs
To the singers
In some lands
Dark night
And cold steel
Prevail
But the dream
Will come back
And the song
Break
Its jail
I live on a park bench
You Park Avenue
Hell of a distance
Between us two
I beg a dime for dinner
You got a butler and maid
But Im wakin up
Say aint you afraid
That I might just maybe
In a year or two
Move on over
To Park Avenue
We passed their graves
The dead men there
Winners or losers
Did not care
In the dark
They could not see
Who had gained
The victory
In an envelope marked
PERSONAL
God addressed me a letter
In an envelope marked
PERSONAL
I have given my answer
I work all day
Said Simple John
Myself a house to buy
I work all day
Said Simple John
But Pierrot wondered why
For Pierrrot loved the long white road
And Pierrot loved the moon
And Pierrot loved a starfilled sky
And the breath of a rose in June
I have one wife
Said Simple John
AndfaithI love her yet
I have one wife
Said Simple John
But Pierrot left Pierrette
For Pierrot saw a world of girls
And Pierrot loved each one
And Pierrot thought all maidens fair
As flowers in the sun
Oh I am good
Said Simple John
The Lord will take me in
Yes I am good
Said Simple John
But Pierrots steeped in sin
For Pierrot played on a slim guitar
And Pierrot loved the moon
And Pierrot ran down the long white road
With the burghers wife one June
When I was home de
Sunshine seemed like gold
When I was home de
Sunshine seemed like gold
Since I come up North de
Whole damn worlds turned cold
I was a good boy
Never done no wrong
Yes I was a good boy
Never done no wrong
But this world is weary
An de road is hard an long
I fell in love with
A gal I thought was kind
Fell in love with
A gal I thought was kind
She made me lose ma money
An almost lose ma mind
Weary weary
Weary early in de morn
Weary weary
Early early in de morn
Is so weary
I wish Id never been born
Only dumb guys fight
If I wasnt dumb
I wouldnt be fightin
I could make six dollars a day
On the docks
And Id save more than I do now
Only dumb guys fight
2 and 2 are 4
4 and 4 are 8
But what would happen
If the last 4 was late
And how would it be
If one 2 was me
Or if the first 4 was you
Divided by 2
When the old junk man Death
Comes to gather up our bodies
And toss them into the sack of oblivion
I wonder if he will find
The corpse of a white multimillionaire
Worth more pennies of eternity
Than the black torso of
A Negro cottonpicker
I would liken you
To a night without stars
Were it not for your eyes
I would liken you
To a sleep without dreams
Were it not for your songs
How still
How strangely still
The water is today
It is not good
For water
To be so still that way
How quiet
It is in this sick room
Where on the bed
A silent woman lies between two lovers
Life and Death
And all three covered with a sheet of pain
I catch the pattern
Of your silence
Before you speak
I do not need
To hear a word
In your silence
Every tone I seek
Is heard
He glides so swiftly
Back into the grass
Gives me the courtesy of road
To let me pass
That I am half ashamed
To seek a stone
To kill him
Way Down South in Dixie
Break the heart of me
They hung my black young lover
To a cross roads tree
Way Down South in Dixie
Bruised body high in air
I asked the white Lord Jesus
What was the use of prayer
Way Down South in Dixie
Break the heart of me
Love is a naked shadow
On a gnarled and naked tree
I sat there singing her
Songs in the dark
She said
I do not understand
The words
I said
There are
No words
been scarred and battered
My hopes the wind done scattered
Snow has friz me
Sun has baked me
Looks like between em they done
Tried to make me
Stop laughin stop lovin stop livin
But I dont care
Im still here
The calm
Cool face of the river
Asked me for a kiss
I woke up this mornin’
’Bout halfpast three
All the womens in town
Was gathered round me
Sweet gals was amoanin’
“Sylvester’s gonna die”
And a hundred pretty mamas
Bowed their heads to cry
I woke up little later
’Bout halfpast fo’
The doctor ‘n’ undertaker’s
Both at ma do’
Black gals was abeggin’
“You can’t leave us here”
Brownskins cryin’ “Daddy
Honey Baby Don’t go dear”
But I felt ma time’s acomin’
And I know’d I’s dyin’ fast
I seed the River Jerden
Acreepin’ muddy past
But I’s still Sweet Papa ’Vester
Yes sir Long as life do last
So I hollers “Com’ere babies
Fo’ to love yo’ daddy right”
And I reaches up to hug ’em
When the Lawd put out the light
Then everything was darkness
In a great big night
When the night winds whistle through the trees and blow the crisp brown leaves acrackling down
When the autumn moon is big and yelloworange and round
When old Jack Frost is sparkling on the ground
Its Thanksgiving Time
When the pantry jars are full of mincemeat and the shelves are laden with sweet spices for a cake
When the butcher man sends up a turkey nice and fat to bake
When the stores are crammed with everything ingenious cooks can make
Its Thanksgiving Time
When the gales of coming winter outside your window howl
When the air is sharp and cheery so it drives away your scowl
When ones appetite craves turkey and will have no other fowl
Its Thanksgiving Time

When the shoe strings break
On both your shoes
And youre in a hurry
Thats the blues
When you go to buy a candy bar
And youve lost the dime you had
Slipped through a hole in your pocket somewhere
Thats the blues too and bad
Submitted by Denice Jackson
In the morning the city
Spreads its wings
Making a song
In stone that sings
In the evening the city
Goes to bed
Hanging lights
Above its head
Bring me all of your dreams
You dreamer
Bring me all your
Heart melodies
That I may wrap them
In a blue cloudcloth
Away from the toorough fingers
Of the world
Children I come back today
To tell you a story of the long dark way
That I had to climb that I had to know
In order that the race might live and grow
Look at my face dark as the night
Yet shining like the sun with loves true light
I am the dark girl who crossed the red sea
Carrying in my body the seed of the free
I am the woman who worked in the field
Bringing the cotton and the corn to yield
I am the one who labored as a slave
Beaten and mistreated for the work that I gave
Children sold away from me Im husband sold too
No safety no love no respect was I due
Three hundred years in the deepest South
But God put a song and a prayer in my mouth
God put a dream like steel in my soul
Now through my children Im reaching the goal
Now through my children young and free
I realized the blessing deed to me
I couldnt read then I couldnt write
I had nothing back there in the night
Sometimes the valley was filled with tears
But I kept trudging on through the lonely years
Sometimes the road was hot with the sun
But I had to keep on till my work was done
I had to keep on No stopping for me
I was the seed of the coming Free
I nourished the dream that nothing could smother
Deep in my breast the Negro mother
I had only hope then but now through you
Dark ones of today my dreams must come true
All you dark children in the world out there
Remember my sweat my pain my despair
Remember my years heavy with sorrow
And make of those years a torch for tomorrow
Make of my pass a road to the light
Out of the darkness the ignorance the night
Lift high my banner out of the dust
Stand like free men supporting my trust
Believe in the right let none push you back
Remember the whip and the slavers track
Remember how the strong in struggle and strife
Still bar you the way and deny you life
But march ever forward breaking down bars
Look ever upward at the sun and the stars
Oh my dark children may my dreams and my prayers
Impel you forever up the great stairs
For I will be with you till no white brother
Dares keep down the children of the Negro Mother
Ive known rivers
Ive known rivers ancient as the world and older than the
flow of human blood in human veins
My soul has grown deep like the rivers
I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young
I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep
I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it
I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln
went down to New Orleans and Ive seen its muddy
bosom turn all golden in the sunset
Ive known rivers
Ancient dusky rivers
My soul has grown deep like the rivers
Droning a drowsy syncopated tune
Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon
I heard a Negro play
Down on Lenox Avenue the other night
By the pale dull pallor of an old gas light
He did a lazy sway
He did a lazy sway
To the tune o those Weary Blues
With his ebony hands on each ivory key
He made that poor piano moan with melody
O Blues
Swaying to and fro on his rickety stool
He played that sad raggy tune like a musical fool
Sweet Blues
Coming from a black mans soul
O Blues
In a deep song voice with a melancholy tone
I heard that Negro sing that old piano moan
Aint got nobody in all this world
Aint got nobody but ma self
Is gwine to quit ma frownin
And put ma troubles on the shelf
Thump thump thump went his foot on the floor
He played a few chords then he sang some more
I got the Weary Blues
And I cant be satisfied
Got the Weary Blues
And cant be satisfied
I aint happy no mo
And I wish that I had died
And far into the night he crooned that tune
The stars went out and so did the moon
The singer stopped playing and went to bed
While the Weary Blues echoed through his head
He slept like a rock or a man thats dead
The instructor said
Go home and write
a page tonight
And let that page come out of you
Then it will be true
I wonder if its that simple
I am twentytwo colored born in WinstonSalem
I went to school there then Durham then here
to this college on the hill above Harlem
I am the only colored student in my class
The steps from the hill lead down into Harlem
through a park then I cross St Nicholas
Eighth Avenue Seventh and I come to the Y
the Harlem Branch Y where I take the elevator
up to my room sit down and write this page
Its not easy to know what is true for you or me
at twentytwo my age But I guess Im what
I feel and see and hear Harlem I hear you
hear you hear mewe twoyou me talk on this page
I hear New York too Mewho
Well I like to eat sleep drink and be in love
I like to work read learn and understand life
I like a pipe for a Christmas present
or recordsBessie bop or Bach
I guess being colored doesnt make me not like
the same things other folks like who are other races
So will my page be colored that I write
Being me it will not be white
But it will be
a part of you instructor
You are white
yet a part of me as I am a part of you
Thats American
Sometimes perhaps you dont want to be a part of me
Nor do I often want to be a part of you
But we are thats true
As I learn from you
I guess you learn from me
although youre olderand white
and somewhat more free
This is my page for English B
I will take you heart
I will take your soul out of your body
As though I were God
I will not be satisfied
With the touch of your hand
Nor the sweet of your lips alone
I will take your heart for mine
I will take your soul
I will be God when it comes to you
You sicken me with lies
With truthful lies
And with your pious faces
And your wide outstretched
mockwelcome Christian hands
While underneath
Is dirt and ugliness
And rotting hearts
And wild hyenas howling
In you souls wasteland
The Negro
With the trumpet at his lips
Has dark moons of weariness
Beneath his eyes
where the smoldering memory
of slave ships
Blazed to the crack of whips
about thighs
The negro
with the trumpet at his lips
has a head of vibrant hair
tamed down
patentleathered now
until it gleams
like jet
were jet a crown
the music
from the trumpet at his lips
is honey
mixed with liquid fire
the rhythm
from the trumpet at his lips
is ecstasy
distilled from old desire
Desire
that is longing for the moon
where the moonlights but a spotlight
in his eyes
desire
that is longing for the sea
where the seas a barglass
sucker size
The Negro
with the trumpet at his lips
whose jacket
Has a fine onebutton roll
does not know
upon what riff the music slips
Its hypodermic needle
to his soul
but softly
as the tune comes from his throat
trouble
mellows to a golden note
Tell all my mourners
To mourn in red
Cause there aint no sense
In my bein dead
Being walkers with the dawn and morning
Walkers with the sun and morning
We are not afraid of night
Nor days of gloom
Nor darkness
Being walkers with the sun and morning
Negroes
Sweet and docile
Meek humble and kind
Beware the day
They change their mind
Wind
In the cotton fields
Gentle Breeze
Beware the hour
It uproots trees
From Christ to Ghandi
Appears this truth
St Francis of Assisi
Proves it too
Goodness becomes grandeur
Surpassing might of kings
Halos of kindness
Brighter shine
Than crowns of gold
And brighter
Than rich diamonds
Sparkles
The simple dew
Of love
When Susanna Jones wears red
her face is like an ancient cameo
Turned brown by the ages
Come with a blast of trumphets Jesus
When Susanna Jones wears red
A queen from some timedead Egyptian night
Walks once again
Blow trumphets Jesus
And the beauty of Susanna Jones in red
Burns in my heart a lovefire sharp like a pain
Sweet silver trumphets Jesus
Over There
World War II

Dear Fellow Americans
I write this letter
Hoping times will be better
When this war
Is through
Im a Tanskinned Yank
Driving a tank
I ask WILL VDAY
BE MEDAY TOO
I wear a U S uniform
Ive done the enemy much harm
Ive driven back
The Germans and the Japs
From Burma to the Rhine
On every battle line
Ive dropped defeat
Into the Fascists laps
I am a Negro American
Out to defend my land
Army Navy Air Corps
I am there
I take munitions through
I fightor stevedore too
I face death the same as you do
Everywhere
Ive seen my buddy lying
Where he fell
Ive watched him dying
I promised him that I would try
To make our land a land
Where his son could be a man
And thered be no Jim Crow birds
Left in our sky
So this is what I want to know
When we see Victorys glow
Will you still let old Jim Crow
Hold me back
When all those foreign folks whove waited
Italians Chinese Danesare liberated
Will I still be illfated
Because Im black
Here in my own my native land
Will the Jim Crow laws still stand
Will Dixie lynch me still
When I return
Or will you comrades in arms
From the factories and the farms
Have learned what this war
Was fought for us to learn
When I take off my uniform
Will I be safe from harm
Or will you do me
As the Germans did the Jews
When Ive helped this world to save
Shall I still be colors slave
Or will Victory change
Your antiquated views
You cant say I didnt fight
To smash the Fascists might
You cant say I wasnt with you
in each battle
As a soldier and a friend
When this war comes to an end
Will you herd me in a Jim Crow car
Like cattle
Or will you stand up like a man
At home and take your stand
For Democracy
Thats all I ask of you
When we lay the guns away
To celebrate
Our Victory Day
WILL VDAY BE MEDAY TOO
Thats what I want to know
Sincerely
GI Joe
We do not care
That much is clear
Not enough
Of us care
Anywhere
We are not wise
For that reason
Mankind dies
To think
Is much against
The will
Better
And easier
To kill
You and your whole race
Look down upon the town in which you live
And be ashamed
Look down upon white folks
And upon yourselves
And be ashamed
That such supine poverty exists there
That such stupid ignorance breeds children there
Behind such humble shelters of despair
That you yourselves have not the sense to care
Nor the manhood to stand up and say
I dare you to come one step nearer evil world
With your hands of greed seeking to touch my throat
I dare you to come one step nearer me
When you can say that
you will be free
