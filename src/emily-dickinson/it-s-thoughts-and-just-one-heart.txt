It's thoughts드nd just One Heart
And Old Sunshine드bout
Make frugal듎nes듂ontent
And two or three듡or Company
Upon a Holiday
Crowded드s Sacrament

Spare the Tenant듧ong eno'
A Picture들f it Care

For needing more
Flowers듮o keep the Eyes듡rom going awkward
When it snows
A Bird들f they듫refer
Though Winter fire듭ing clear as Plover
To our든ar
A Landscape듩ot so great
To suffocate the Eye
A Hill듫erhaps
Perhaps듮he profile of a Mill
Turned by the Wind
Tho' such드re luxuries
It's thoughts드nd just two Heart
And Heaven드bout
At least드 Counterfeit
We would not have Correct
And Immortality듞an be almost
Not quite듂ontent
