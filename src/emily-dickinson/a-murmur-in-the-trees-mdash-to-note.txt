A Murmur in the Trees듮o note
Not loud enough듡or Wind
A Star듩ot far enough to seek
Nor near enough듮o find
A long듧ong Yellow듪n the Lawn
A Hubbub드s of feet
Not audible드s Ours듮o Us
But dapperer듌ore Sweet
A Hurrying Home of little Men
To Houses unperceived
All this드nd more들f I should tell
Would never be believed
Of Robins in the Trundle bed
How many I espy
Whose Nightgowns could not hide the Wings
Although I heard them try
But then I promised ne'er to tell
How could I break My Word
So go your Way드nd I'll go Mine
No fear you'll miss the Road
