I'm sorry for the Dead듒oday
It's such congenial times
Old Neighbors have at fences
It's time o' year for Hay
And Broad듑unburned Acquaintance
Discourse between the Toil
And laugh a homely species
That makes the Fences smile
It seems so straight to lie away
From all of the noise of Fields
The Busy Carts듮he fragrant Cocks
The Mower's Metre듑teals
A Trouble lest they're homesick
Those Farmers드nd their Wives
Set separate from the Farming
And all the Neighbors' lives
A Wonder if the Sepulchre
Don't feel a lonesome way
When Men드nd Boys드nd Carts드nd June
Go down the Fields to "Hay"
