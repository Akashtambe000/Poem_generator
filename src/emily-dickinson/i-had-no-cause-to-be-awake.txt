I had no Cause to be awake
My Best등as gone to sleep
And Morn a new politeness took
And failed to wake them up
But called the others듞lear
And passed their Curtains by
Sweet Morning등hen I oversleep
KnockRecollect듮o Me
I looked at Sunrise듎nce
And then I looked at Them
And wishfulness in me arose
For Circumstance the same
'Twas such an Ample Peace
It could not hold a Sigh
'Twas Sabbath등ith the Bells divorced
'Twas Sunset드ll the Day
So choosing but a Gown
And taking but a Prayer
The only Raiment I should need
I struggled드nd was There
