277
What if I say I shall not wait
What if I burst the fleshly Gate
And pass escaped듮o thee
What if I file this Mortal듪ff
See where it hurt me듒hat's enough
And wade in Liberty
They cannot take me드ny more
Dungeons can call드nd Guns implore
Unmeaning듩ow듮o me
As laughter등as드n hour ago
Or Laces듪r a Travelling Show
Or who died듳esterday
