Those fair듡ictitious People
The Women듫lucked away
From our familiar Lifetime
The Men of Ivory
Those Boys and Girls in Canvas
Who stay upon the Wall
In Everlasting Keepsake
Can Anybody tell
We trust들n places perfecter
Inheriting Delight
Beyond our faint Conjecture
Our dizzy Estimate
Remembering ourselves we trust
Yet Blesseder듮han We
Through Knowing등here We only hope
Receiving등here we듫ray
Of Expectation드lso
Anticipating us
With transport that would be a pain
Except for Holiness
Esteeming us드s Exile
Themself드dmitted Home
Through easy Miracle of Death
The Way ourself must come
