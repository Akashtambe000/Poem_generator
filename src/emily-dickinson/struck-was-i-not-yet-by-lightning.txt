Struck was I not yet by Lightning
Lightning듧ets away
Power to perceive His Process
With Vitality
Maimed등as I듳et not by Venture
Stone of stolid Boy
Nor a Sportsman's Peradventure
Who mine Enemy
Robbed등as I들ntact to Bandit
All my Mansion torn
Sun등ithdrawn to Recognition
Furthest shining듟one
Yet was not the foe듪f any
Not the smallest Bird
In the nearest Orchard dwelling
Be of Me드fraid
Most듈 love the Cause that slew Me
Often as I die
Its beloved Recognition
Holds a Sun on Me
Best드t Setting드s is Nature's
Neither witnessed Rise
Till the infinite Aurora
In the other's eyes
