Of Brussels들t was not
Of Kidderminster Nay
The Winds did buy it of the Woods
They듭old it unto me
It was a gentle price
The poorest듞ould afford
It was within the frugal purse
Of Beggar듪r of Bird
Of small and spicy Yards
In hue드 mellow Dun
Of Sunshine드nd of Sere듂omposed
But principally듪f Sun
The Wind듯nrolled it fast
And spread it on the Ground
Upholsterer of the Pines들s He
Upholsterer듪f the Pond
