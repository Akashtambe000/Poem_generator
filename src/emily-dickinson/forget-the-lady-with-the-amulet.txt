Forget The lady with the Amulet
Forget she wore it at her Heart
Because she breathed against
Was Treason twixt
Deny Did Rose her Bee
For Privilege of Play
Or Wile of Butterfly
Or Opportunity듇er Lord away
The lady with the Amulet등ill face
The Bee들n Mausoleum laid
Discard his Bride
But longer than the little Rill
That cooled the Forehead of the Hill
While Other등ent the Sea to fill
And Other등ent to turn the Mill
I'll do thy Will
