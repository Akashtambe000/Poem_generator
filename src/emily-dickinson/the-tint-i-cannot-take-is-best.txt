627
The Tint I cannot take들s best
The Color too remote
That I could show it in Bazaar
A Guinea at a sight
The fine들mpalpable Array
That swaggers on the eye
Like Cleopatra's Company
Repeated들n the sky
The Moments of Dominion
That happen on the Soul
And leave it with a Discontent
Too exquisite듮o tell
The eager look듪n Landscapes
As if they just repressed
Some Secret듮hat was pushing
Like Chariots들n the Vest
The Pleading of the Summer
That other Prank듪f Snow
That Cushions Mystery with Tulle
For fear the Squirrels듦now
Their Graspless manners듨ock us
Until the Cheated Eye
Shuts arrogantly들n the Grave
Another way듮o see
