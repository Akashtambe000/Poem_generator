716
The Day undressed듇erself
Her Garter등as of Gold
Her Petticoat듪f Purple plain
Her Dimities드s old
Exactly드s the World
And yet the newest Star
Enrolled upon the Hemisphere
Be wrinkled듨uch as Her
Too near to God듮o pray
Too near to Heaven듮o fear
The Lady of the Occident
Retired without a care
Her Candle so expire
The flickering be seen
On Ball of Mast in Bosporus
And Dome드nd Window Pane
