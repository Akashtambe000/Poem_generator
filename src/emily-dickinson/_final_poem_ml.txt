A bird came down the walk
He did not know I saw
He bit an angleworm in halves
And ate the fellow raw
And then he drank a dew
From a convenient grass
And then hopped sidewise to the wall
To let a beetle pass
He glanced with rapid eyes
That hurried all abroad
They looked like frightened beads I thought
He stirred his velvet head
Like one in danger cautious
I offered him a crumb
And he unrolled his feathers
And rowed him softer home
Than oars divide the ocean
Too silver for a seam
Or butterflies off banks of noon
Leap splashless as they swim
There is no frigate like a book
To take us lands away
Nor any coursers like a page
Of prancing poetry
This traverse may the poorest take
Without oppress of toll
How frugal is the chariot
That bears a human soul
A Burdockclawed my Gown
Not Burdocksblame
But mine
Who went too near
The Burdocks Den
A Bogaffronts my shoe
What else have Bogsto do
The only Trade they know
The splashing Men
Ah pitythen
Tis Minnows can despise
The Elephantscalm eyes
Look further on
A Charm invests a face
Imperfectly beheld
The Lady dare not lift her Veil
For fear it be dispelled
But peers beyond her mesh
And wishesand denies
Lest Interviewannul a want
That Imagesatisfies
A chilly Peace infests the Grass
The Sun respectful lies
Not any Trance of industry
These shadows scrutinize
Whose Allies go no more astray
For service or for Glee
But all mankind deliver here
From whatsoever sea
A clock stopped not the mantels
Genevas farthest skill
Cant put the puppet bowing
That just now dangled still
An awe came on the trinket
The figures hunched with pain
Then quivered out of decimals
Into degreeless noon
It will not stir for doctors
This pendulum of snow
The shopman importunes it
While cool concernless No
Nods from the gilded pointers
Nods from seconds slim
Decades of arrogance between
The dial life and him
A Cloud withdrew from the Sky
Superior Glory be
But that Cloud and its Auxiliaries
Are forever lost to me
Had I but further scanned
Had I secured the Glow
In an Hermetic Memory
It had availed me now
Never to pass the Angel
With a glance and a Bow
Till I am firm in Heaven
Is my intention now
A Coffinis a small Domain
Yet able to contain
A Citizen of Paradise
In it diminished Plane
A Graveis a restricted Breadth
Yet ampler than the Sun
And all the Seas He populates
And Lands He looks upon
To Him who on its small Repose
Bestows a single Friend
Circumference without Relief
Or Estimateor End
A Counterfeit a Plated Person
I would not be
Whatever strata of Iniquity
My Nature underlie
Truth is good Health and Safety and the Sky
How meagre what an Exile is a Lie
And Vocal when we die
A darting feara pompa tear
A waking on a morn
To find that what one waked for
Inhales the different dawn
A Day Help Help Another Day
Your prayers oh Passer by
From such a common ball as this
Might date a Victory
From marshallings as simple
The flags of nations swang
Steadymy soul What issues
Upon thine arrow hang
A Death blow is a Life blow to Some
Who till they died did not alive become
Who had they lived had died but when
They died Vitality begun
A door just opened on a street
I lost was passing by
An instants width of warmth disclosed
And wealth and company
The door as sudden shut and I
I lost was passing by
Lost doubly but by contrast most
Enlightening misery
A doubt if it be Us
Assists the staggering Mind
In an extremer Anguish
Until it footing find
An Unreality is lent
A merciful Mirage
That makes the living possible
While it suspends the lives
A drop fell on the apple tree
Another on the roof
A half a dozen kissed the eaves
And made the gables laugh
A few went out to help the brook
That went to help the sea
Myself conjectured Were they pearls
What necklaces could be
The dust replaced in hoisted roa
The birds jocoser sung
The sunshine threw his hat away
The orchards spangles hung
The breezes brought dejected
And bathed them in the glee
The East put out a single flag
And signed the fete away
A Dying Tigermoaned for Drink
I hunted all the Sand
I caught the Dripping of a Rock
And bore it in my Hand
His Mighty Ballsin death were thick
But searchingI could see
A Vision on the Retina
Of Waterand of me
Twas not my blamewho sped too slow
Twas not his blamewho died
While I was reaching him
But twasthe fact that He was dead
A feather from the Whippoorwill
That everlastingsings
Whose galleriesare Sunrise
Whose Operathe Springs
Whose Emerald Nest the Ages spin
Of mellowmurmuring thread
Whose Beryl Egg what Schoolboys hunt
In RecessOverhead
A first Mute Coming
In the Strangers House
A first fair Going
When the Bells rejoice
A first Exchangeof
What hath mingledbeen
For Lotexhibited to
Faithalone
A fuzzy fellow without feet
Yet doth exceeding run
Of velvet is his Countenance
And his Complexion dun
Sometime he dwelleth in the grass
Sometime upon a bough
From which he doth descend in plush
Upon the Passerby
All this in summer
But when winds alarm the Forest Folk
He taketh Damask Residence
And struts in sewing silk
Then finer than a Lady
Emerges in the spring
A Feather on each shoulder
Youd scarce recognize him
By Men yclept Caterpillar
By me But who am I
To tell the pretty secret
Of the Butterfly
A great Hope fell
You heard no noise
The Ruin was within
Oh cunning wreck that told no tale
And let no Witness in
The mind was built for mighty Freight
For dread occasion planned
How often foundering at Sea
Ostensibly on Land
A not admitting of the wound
Until it grew so wide
That all my Life had entered it
And there were troughs beside
A closing of the simple lid
That opened to the sun
Until the tender Carpenter
Perpetual nail it down
A happy lipbreaks sudden
It doesnt state you how
It contemplatedsmiling
Just consummatednow
But this one wears its merriment
So patientlike a pain
Fresh gildedto elude the eyes
Unqualified to scan
A House upon the Height
That Wagon never reached
No Dead were ever carried down
No Peddlers Cartapproached
Whose Chimney never smoked
Whose WindowsNight and Morn
Caught Sunrise firstand Sunsetlast
Thenheld an Empty Pane
Whose fateConjecture knew
No other neighbordid
And what it waswe never lisped
Because Henever told
A Lady redamid the Hill
Her annual secret keeps
A Lady white within the Field
In placid Lily sleeps
The tidy Breezes with their Brooms
Sweep valeand hilland tree
Prithee My pretty Housewives
Who may expected be
The Neighbors do not yet suspect
The Woods exchange a smile
Orchard and Buttercup and Bird
In such a little while
And yet how still the Landscape stands
How nonchalant the Hedge
As if the Resurrection
Were nothing very strange
A lane of Yellow led the eye
Unto a Purple Wood
Whose soft inhabitants to be
Surpasses solitude
If Bird the silence contradict
Or flower presume to show
In that low summer of the West
Impossible to know
A light exists in spring
Not present on the year
At any other period
When March is scarcely here
A color stands abroad
On solitary hills
That science cannot overtake
But human naturefeels
It waits upon the lawn
It shows the furthest tree
Upon the furthest slope we know
It almost speaks to me
Then as horizons step
Or noons report away
Without the formula of sound
It passes and we stay
A quality of loss
Affecting our content
As trade had suddenly encroached
Upon a sacrament
A little breada crusta crumb
A little trusta demijohn
Can keep the soul alive
Not portly mind but breathingwarm
Consciousas old Napoleon
The night before the Crown
A modest lotA fame petite
A brief Campaign of sting and sweet
Is plenty Is enough
A Sailors business is the shore
A Soldiersballs Who asketh more
Must seek the neighboring life
A little Dog that wags his tail
And knows no other joy
Of such a little Dog am I
Reminded by a Boy
Who gambols all the living Day
Without an earthly cause
Because he is a little Boy
I honestly suppose
The Cat that in the Corner dwells
Her martial Day forgot
The Mouse but a Tradition now
Of her desireless Lot
Another class remind me
Who neither please nor play
But not to make a bit of noise
Beseech each little Boy
A little East of Jordan
Evangelists record
A Gymnast and an Angel
Did wrestle long and hard
Till morning touching mountain
And Jacob waxing strong
The Angel begged permission
To Breakfastto return
Not so said cunning Jacob
I will not let thee go
Except thou bless meStranger
The which acceded to
Light swung the silver fleeces
Peniel Hills beyond
And the bewildered Gymnast
Found he had worsted God
A little Madness in the Spring
Is wholesome even for the King
But God be with the Clown
Who ponders this tremendous scene
This whole Experiment of Green
As if it were his own
A little road not made of man
Enabled of the eye
Accessible to thill of bee
Or cart of butterfly
If town it have beyond itself
T is that I cannot say
I only sighno vehicle
Bears me along that way
A little Snow was here and there
Disseminated in her Hair
Since she and I had met and played
Decade had gathered to Decade
But Time had added not obtained
Impregnable the Rose
For summer too indelible
Too obdurate for Snows
A long long sleep a famous sleep
That makes no show for dawn
By strech of limb or stir of lid
An independent one
Was ever idleness like this
Within a hut of stone
To bask the centuries away
Nor once look up for noon
A loss of something ever felt I
The first that I could recollect
Bereft I wasof what I knew not
Too young that any should suspect
A Mourner walked among the children
I notwithstanding went about
As one bemoaning a Dominion
Itself the only Prince cast out
Elder Today a session wiser
And fainter too as Wiseness is
I find myself still softly searching
For my Delinguent Palaces
And a Suspicion like a Finger
Touches my Forehead now and then
That I am looking oppositely
For the site of the Kingdom of Heaven
A Man may make a Remark
In itselfa quiet thing
That may furnish the Fuse unto a Spark
In dormant naturelain
Let us deportwith skill
Let us discoursewith care
Powder exists in Charcoal
Before it exists in Fire
A Mien to move a Queen
Half ChildHalf Heroine
An Orleans in the Eye
That puts its manner by
For humbler Company
When none are near
Even a Tear
Its frequent Visitor
A Bonnet like a Duke
And yet a Wrens Peruke
Were not so shy
Of Goer by
And Handsso slight
They would elate a Sprite
With Merriment
A Voice that AltersLow
And on the Ear can go
Like Let of Snow
Or shift supreme
As tone of Realm
On Subjects Diadem
Too smallto fear
Too distantto endear
And so Men Compromise
And justrevere
A Moth the hue of this
Haunts Candles in Brazil
Natures Experience would make
Our Reddest Second pale
Nature is fond I sometimes think
Of Trinkets as a Girl
A Murmur in the Treesto note
Not loud enoughfor Wind
A Starnot far enough to seek
Nor near enoughto find
A longlong Yellowon the Lawn
A Hubbubas of feet
Not audibleas Oursto Us
But dappererMore Sweet
A Hurrying Home of little Men
To Houses unperceived
All thisand moreif I should tell
Would never be believed
Of Robins in the Trundle bed
How many I espy
Whose Nightgowns could not hide the Wings
Although I heard them try
But then I promised neer to tell
How could I break My Word
So go your Wayand Ill go Mine
No fear youll miss the Road
A narrow fellow in the grass
Occasionally rides
You may have met himdid you not
His notice sudden is
The grass divides as with a comb
A spotted shaft is seen
And then it closes at your feet
And opens further on
He likes a boggy acre
A floor too cool for corn
Yet when a child and barefoot
I more than once at morn
Have passed I thought a whiplash
Unbraiding in the sun
When stooping to secure it
It wrinkled and was gone
Several of natures people
I know and they know me
I feel for them a transport
Of cordiality
But never met this fellow
Attended or alone
Without a tighter breathing
And zero at the bone
A nearness to Tremendousness
An Agony procures
Affliction ranges Boundlessness
Vicinity to Laws
Contentments quiet Suburb
Affliction cannot stay
In AcresIts Location
Is Illocality
A Nightthere lay the Days between
The Day that was Before
And Day that was Behindwere one
And nowtwas Nightwas here
SlowNightthat must be watched away
As Grains upon a shore
Too imperceptible to note
Till it be nightno more
A Pang is more conspicuous in Spring
In contrast with the things that sing
Not Birds entirely but Minds
Minute Effulgencies and Winds
When what they sung for is undone
Who cares about a Blue Birds Tune
Why Resurrection had to wait
Till they had moved a Stone
A Planted Lifediversified
With Gold and Silver Pain
To prove the presence of the Ore
In Particlestis when
A Value struggleit exist
A Powerwill proclaim
Although Annihilation pile
Whole Chaoses on Him
A poortorn hearta tattered heart
That sat it down to rest
Nor noticed that the Ebbing Day
Flowed silver to the West
Nor noticed Night did soft descend
Nor Constellation burn
Intent upon the vision
Of latitudes unknown
The angelshappening that way
This dusty heart espied
Tenderly took it up from toil
And carried it to God
Theresandals for the Barefoot
Theregathered from the gales
Do the blue havens by the hand
Lead the wandering Sails
A preciousmouldering pleasuretis
To meet an Antique Book
In just the Dress his Century wore
A privilegeI think
His venerable Hand to take
And warming in our own
A passage backor twoto make
To Times when hewas young
His quaint opinionsto inspect
His thought to ascertain
On Themes concern our mutual mind
The Literature of Man
What interested Scholarsmost
What Competitions ran
When Platowas a Certainty
And Sophoclesa Man
When Sapphowas a living Girl
And Beatrice wore
The Gown that Dantedeified
Facts Centuries before
He traversesfamiliar
As One should come to Town
And tell you all your Dreamswere true
He livedwhere Dreams were born
His presence is Enchantment
You beg him not to go
Old Volume shake their Vellum Heads
And tantalizejust so
A Prison gets to be a friend
Between its Ponderous face
And Oursa Kinsmanship express
And in its narrow Eyes
We come to look with gratitude
For the appointed Beam
It deal usstated as our food
And hungered forthe same
We learn to know the Planks
That answer to Our feet
So miserable a soundat first
Nor ever nowso sweet
As plashing in the Pools
When Memory was a Boy
But a Demurer Circuit
A Geometric Joy
The Posture of the Key
That interrupt the Day
To Our EndeavorNot so real
The Check of Liberty
As this Phantasm Steel
Whose featuresDay and Night
Are present to usas Our Own
And as escapelessquite
The narrow Roundthe Stint
The slow exchange of Hope
For something passiverContent
Too steep for lookinp up
The Liberty we knew
Avoidedlike a Dream
Too wide for any Night but Heaven
If Thatindeedredeem
A Route of Evanescence
With a revolving Wheel
A Resonance of Emerald
A Rush of Cochineal
And every Blossom on the Bush
Adjusts its tumbled Head
The mail from Tunis probably
An easy Mornings Ride
A scienceso the Savants say
Comparative Anatomy
By which a single bone
Is made a secret to unfold
Of some rare tenant of the mold
Else perished in the stone
So to the eye prospective led
This meekest flower of the mead
Upon a winters day
Stands representative in gold
Of Rose and Lily manifold
And countless Butterfly
A Secret told
Ceases to be a Secretthen
A Secretkept
Thatcan appal but One
Better of itcontinual be afraid
Than it
And Whom you told it tobeside
A sepal petal and a thorn
Upon a common summers morn
A flask of DewA Bee or two
A Breezea caper in the trees
And Im a Rose
A Shade upon the mind there passes
As when on Noon
A Cloud the mighty Sun encloses
Remembering
That some there be too numb to notice
Oh God
Why give if Thou must take away
The Loved
A shady friend for torrid days
Is easier to find
Than one of higher temperature
For frigid hour of mind
The vane a little to the east
Scares muslin souls away
If broadcloth breasts are firmer
Than those of organdy
Who is to blame The weaver
Ah the bewildering thread
The tapestries of paradise
So notelessly are made
A Sickness of this World it most occasions
When Best Men die
A Wishfulness their far Condition
To occupy
A Chief indifference as Foreign
A World must be
Themselves forsake contented
For Deity
Is all that pins the Soul
That stands for Deity to Mine
Upon my side the Veil
Once witnessed of the Gauze
Its name is put away
As far from mine as if no plight
Had printed yesterday
In tendersolemn Alphabet
My eyes just turned to see
When it was smuggled by my sight
Into Eternity
More Handsto holdThese are but Two
One more newmailed Nerve
Just granted for the Perils sake
Some stridingGiantLove
So greater than the Gods can show
They slink before the Clay
That not for all their Heaven can boast
Will let its Keepsakego
A slash of Blue
A sweep of Gray
Some scarlet patches on the way
Compose an Evening Sky
A little purpleslipped between
Some Ruby Trousers hurried on
A Wave of Gold
A Bank of Day
This just makes out the Morning Sky
A Sloop of Amber slips away
Upon an Ether Sea
And wrecks in Peace a Purple Tar
The Son of Ecstasy
A solemn thingit wasI said
A womanwhiteto be
And wearif God should count me fit
Her blameless mystery
A hallowed thingto drop a life
Into the purple well
Too plummetlessthat it return
Eternityuntil
brI pondered how the bliss would look
And would it feel as big
When I could take it in my hand
As hoveringseenthrough fog
And thenthe size of this small life
The Sagescall it small
Swelledlike Horizonsin my vest
And I sneeredsoftlysmall
A Solemn thing within the Soul
To feel itself get ripe
And golden hangwhile farther up
The Makers Ladders stop
And in the Orchard far below
You hear a Beingdrop
A Wonderfulto feel the Sun
Still toiling at the Cheek
You thought was finished
Cool of eye and critical of Work
He shifts the stema little
To give your Corea look
But solemnestto know
Your chance in Harvest moves
A little nearerEvery Sun
The Singleto some lives
A something in a summers Day
As slow her flambeaux burn away
Which solemnizes me
A something in a summers noon
A depthan Azurea perfume
Transcending ecstasy
And still within a summers night
A something so transporting bright
I clap my hands to see
Then veil my too inspecting face
Lets such a subtleshimmering grace
Flutter too far for me
The wizard fingers never rest
The purple brook within the breast
Still chafes it narrow bed
Still rears the East her amber Flag
Guides still the sun along the Crag
His Caravan of Red
So looking onthe nightthe morn
Conclude the wonder gay
And I meet coming thro the dews
Another summers Day
A South Windhas a pathos
Of individual Voice
As One detect on Landings
An Emigrants address
A Hint of Ports and Peoples
And much not understood
The fairerfor the farness
And for the foreignhood
A Spider sewed at Night
Without a Light
Upon an Arc of White
If Ruff it was of Dame
Or Shroud of Gnome
Himself himself inform
Of Immortality
His Strategy
Was Physiognomy
A stillVolcanoLife
That flickered in the night
When it was dark enough to do
Without erasing sight
A quietEarthquake Style
Too subtle to suspect
By natures this side Naples
The North cannot detect
The SolemnTorridSymbol
The lips that never lie
Whose hissing Corals partand shut
And Citiesooze away
A thought went up my mind today
That I have had before
But did not finishsome way back
I could not fix the year
Nor where it went nor why it came
The second time to me
Nor definitely what it was
Have I the art to say
But somewhere in my soul I know
Ive met the thing before
It just reminded met was all
And came my way no more
A throe upon the features
A hurry in the breath
An ecstasy of parting
Denominated Death
An anguish at the mention
Which when to patience grown
Ive known permission given
To rejoin its own
A toad can die of light
Death is the common right
Of toads and men
Of earl and midge
The privilege
Why swagger then
The gnats supremacy
Is large as thine
A Tongueto tell Him I am true
Its feeto be of Gold
Had Naturein Her monstrous House
A single Ragged Child
To earn a Minewould run
That Interdicted Way
And tell HimCharge thee speak it plain
That so farTruth is True
And answer What I do
Beginning with the Day

My Messagemust be told
Saylast I saidwas This
That when the Hillscome down
And hold no higher than the Plain
My Bondhave just begun
And when the Heavensdisband
And Deity conclude
Thenlook for me Be sure you say
Least Figureon the Road
A Tooth upon Our Peace
The Peace cannot deface
Then Wherefore be the Tooth
To vitalize the Grace
The Heaven hath a Hell
Itself to signalize
And every sign before the Place
Is Gilt with Sacrifice
A train went through a burial gate
A bird broke forth and sang
And trilled and quivered and shook his throat
Till all the churchyard rang
And then adjusted his little notes
And bowed and sang again
Doubtless he thought it meet of him
To say goodby to men
A transport one cannot contain
May yet a transport be
Though God forbid it lift the lid
Unto its Ecstasy
A Diagramof Rapture
A sixpence at a Show
With Holy Ghosts in Cages
The Universe would go
A Visitor in Marl
Who influences Flowers
Till they are orderly as Busts
And Elegantas Glass
Who visits in the Night
And just before the Sun
Concludes his glistening interview
Caressesand is gone
But whom his fingers touched
And where his feet have run
And whatsoever Mouth be kissed
Is as it had not been
A Weight with Needles on the pounds
To push and pierce besides
That if the Flesh resist the Heft
The puncturecoolly tries
That not a pore be overlooked
Of all this Compound Frame
As manifold for Anguish
As Speciesbefor name
A Wifeat daybreak I shall be
SunriseHast thou a Flag for me
At Midnight I am but a Maid
How short it takes to make a Bride
ThenMidnight I have passed from thee
Unto the East and Victory
MidnightGood Night I hear them call
The Angels bustle in the Hall
Softly my Future climbs the Stair
I fumble at my Childhoods prayer
So soon to be a Child no more
Eternity Im comingSire
SaviorIve seen the facebefore
A Wind that rose
Though not a Leaf
In any Forest stirred
But with itself did cold engage
Beyond the Realm of Bird
A Wind that woke a lone Delight
Like Separations Swell
Restored in Arctic Confidence
To the Invisible
A Word dropped careless on a Page
May stimulate an eye
When folded in perpetual seam
The Wrinkled Maker lie
Infection in the sentence breeds
We may inhale Despair
At distances of Centuries
From the Malaria
A Wounded Deerleaps highest
Ive heard the Hunter tell
Tis but the Ecstasy of death
And then the Brake is still
The Smitten Rock that gushes
The trampled Steel that springs
A Cheek is always redder
Just where the Hectic stings
Mirth is the Mail of Anguish
In which it Cautious Arm
Lest anybody spy the blood
And youre hurt exclaim
Abraham to kill him
Was distinctly told
Isaac was an Urchin
Abraham was old
Not a hesitation
Abraham complied
Flattered by Obeisance
Tyranny demurred
Isaacto his children
Lived to tell the tale
Moralwith a mastiff
Manners may prevail
Absence disembodiesso does Death
Hiding individuals from the Earth
Superposition helps as well as love
Tenderness decreases as we prove
Absent Placean April Day
Daffodils ablow
Homesick curiosity
To the Souls that snow
Drift may block within it
Deeper than without
Daffodil delight but
Him it duplicate
Adrift A little boat adrift
And night is coming down
Will no one guide a little boat
Unto the nearest town
So Sailors sayon yesterday
Just as the dusk was brown
One little boat gave up its strife
And gurgled down and down
So angels sayon yesterday
Just as the dawn was red
One little boatoerspent with gales
Retrimmed its mastsredecked its sails
And shotexultant on
Afraid Of whom am I afraid
Not Deathfor who is He
The Porter of my Fathers Lodge
As much abasheth me
Of Life Twere odd I fear a thing
That comprehendeth me
In one or two existences
As Deity decree
Of Resurrection Is the East
Afraid to trust the Morn
With her fastidious forehead
As soon impeach my Crown
After a hundred years
Nobody knows the place
Agony that enacted there
Motionless as peace
Weeds triumphant ranged
Strangers strolled and spelled
At the lone orthography
Of the elder dead
Winds of summer fields
Recollect the way
Instinct picking up the key
Dropped by memory
After great pain a formal feeling comes
The Nerves sit ceremonious like Toombs
The stiff Heart questions was it He that bore
And Yesterday or Centuries before
The Feet mechanical go round
Of Ground or Air or Ought
A Wooden way
Regardless grown
A Quartz contentment like a stone
This is the Hour of Lead
Remembered if outlived
As Freezing persons recollect the Snow
FirstChillthen Stuporthen the letting go
Againhis voice is at the door
I feel the old Degree
I hear him ask the servant
For such an oneas me
I take a floweras I go
My face to justify
He never saw mein this life
I might surprise his eye
I cross the Hall with mingled steps
Isilentpass the door
I look on all this world contains
Just his facenothing more
We talk in carelessand it toss
A kind of plummet strain
Eachsoundingshyly mdash
Justhowdeep
The others onehad been
We walkI leave my Dogat home
A tenderthoughtful Moon
Goes with usjust a little way
Andthenwe are alone
Aloneif Angels are alone
First time they try the sky
Aloneif those veiled facesbe
We cannot counton High

The purplein my Vein
But He must count the dropshimself
My price for every stain
Ah Moonand Star
You are very far
But were no one
Farther than you
Do you think Id stop
For a Firmament
Or a Cubitor so
I could borrow a Bonnet
Of the Lark
And a Chamois Silver Boot
And a stirrup of an Antelope
And be with youTonight
But Moon and Star
Though youre very far
There is onefarther than you
Heis more than a firmamentfrom Me
So I can never go

Oh Happy Air

Essential Host in Lifes faint wailing Inn
Later than Light thy Consciousness accost me
Till it depart persuading Mine
All but Death can be Adjusted

All Circumstances are the Frame
In which His Face is set
All Latitudes exist for His
Sufficient Continent

The Leisure of His Will
In Him Existence serve or set
A Force illegible
All forgot for recollecting
Just a paltry One
All forsook for just a Strangers
New Accompanying
Grace of Wealth and Grace of Station

Prove Myselfof Thee
All I may if small
Do it not display
Larger for the Totalness
Tis Economy
To bestow a World
And withhold a Star
Utmost is Munificence
Less tho larger poor
All men for Honor hardest work
But are not known to earn
Paid after they have ceased to work
In Infamy or Urn
All overgrown by cunning moss
All interspersed with weed
The little cage of Currer Bell
In quiet Haworth laid
Gathered from many wanderings
Gethsemane can tell
Thro what transporting anguish
She reached the Asphodel
Soft falls the sounds of Eden
Upon her puzzled ear
Oh what an afternoon for Heaven
When Bronte entered there
All the letters I can write
Are not fair as this
Syllables of Velvet
Sentences of Plush
Depths of Ruby undrained
Hid Lip for Thee
Play it were a Humming Bird
And just sippedme
All these my banners be
I sow my pageantry
In May
It rises train by train
Then sleeps in state again
My chancelall the plain
Today
To loseif one can find again
To missif one shall meet
The Burglar cannot robthen
The Broker cannot cheat
So build the hillocks gaily
Thou little spade of mine
Leaving nooks for Daisy
And for Columbine
You and I the secret
Of the Crocus know
Let us chant it softly
There is no more snow
To him who keeps an Orchis heart
The swamps are pink with June
Alone I cannot be
For Hostsdo visit me
Recordless Company
Who baffle Key
They have no Robes nor Names
No Almanacsnor Climes
But general Homes
Like Gnomes
Their Coming may be known
By Couriers within
Their goingis not
For theyve never gone
Alter When the Hills do
Falter When the Sun
Question if His Glory
Be the Perfect One
Surfeit When the Daffodil
Doth of the Dew
Even as HerselfSir
I willof You
Although I put away his life
An Ornament too grand
For Forehead low as mine to wear
This might have been the Hand
That sowed the flower he preferred
Or smoothed a homely pain
Or pushed the pebble from his path
Or played his chosen tune
On Lute the leastthe latest
But just his Ear could know
That whatsoeer delighted it
I never would let go
The foot to bear his errand
A little Boot I know
Would leap abroad like Antelope
With just the grant to do
His weariest Commandment
A sweeter to obey
Than Hide and Seek
Or skip to Flutes
Or all Day chase the Bee
Your Servant Sir will weary
The Surgeon will not come
The World will have its ownto do
The Dust will vex your Fame
The Cold will force your tightest door
Some February Day
But say my apron bring the sticks
To make your Cottage gay
That I may take that promise
To Paradise with me
To teach the Angels avarice
You Sir taught firstto me
Always Mine
No more Vacation
Term of Light this Day begun
Failless as the fair rotation
Of the Seasons and the Sun
Old the Grace but new the Subjects
Old indeed the East
Yet upon His Purple Programme
Every Dawn is first
Ambition cannot find him
Affection doesnt know
How many leagues of nowhere
Lie between them now
Yesterday undistinguished
Eminent Today
For our mutual hone Immortality
Ample make this bed
Make this bed with awe
In it wait till judgment break
Excellent and fair
Be its mattress straight
Be its pillow round
Let no sunrise yellow noise
Interrupt this ground
An altered look about the hills
A Tyrian light the village fills
A wider sunrise in the morn
A deeper twilight on the lawn
A print of a vermillion foot
A purple finger on the slope
A flippant fly upon the pane
A spider at his trade again
An added strut in Chanticleer
A flower expected everywhere
An axe shrill singing in the woods
Fern odors on untravelled roads
All this and more I cannot tell
A furtive look you know as well
And Nicodemus Mystery
Receives its annual reply
An Antiquated Tree
Is cherished of the Crow
Because that Junior Foliage is disrespectful now
To venerable Birds
Whose Corporation Coat
Would decorate Oblivions
Remotest Consulate
An awful Tempest mashed the air
The clouds were gaunt and few
A Blackas of a Spectres Cloak
Hid Heaven and Earth from view
The creatures chuckled on the Roofs
And whistled in the air
And shook their fists
And gnashed their teeth
And swung their frenzied hair
The morning litthe Birds arose
The Monsters faded eyes
Turned slowly to his native coast
And peacewas Paradise
UP with the sun the breeze arose
Across the talking corn she goes
And smooth she rustles far and wide
Through all the voiceful countryside
Through all the land her tale she tells
She spins she tosses she compels
The kites the clouds the windmill sails
And all the trees in all the dales
God calls us and the day prepares
With nimble gay and gracious airs
And from Penzance to Maidenhead
The roads last night He watered
God calls us from inglorious ease
Forth and to travel with the breeze
While swift and singing smooth and strong
She gallops by the fields along
An everywhere of silver
With ropes of sand
To keep it from effacing
The track called land
An Hour is a Sea
Between a few and me
With them would Harbor be
An ignorance a Sunset
Confer upon the Eye
Of TerritoryColor
Circumferencemda shDecay
Its Amber Revelation
ExhilirateDebase
O mnipotence inspection
Of Our inferior face
And when the solemn features
Confirmin Victory
We startas if detected
In Immortality
And this of all my Hopes
This is the silent end
Bountiful colored my Morning rose
Early and sere its end
Never Bud from a Stem
Stepped with so gay a Foot
Never a Worm so confident
Bored at so brave a Root
And with what body do they come
Then they do come Rejoice
What Door What Hour Run run My Soul
Illuminate the House
Body Then real a Face and Eyes
To know that it is them
Paul knew the Man that knew the News
He passed through Bethlehem
Angels in the early morning

Do the Buds to them belong
Angels when the sun is hottest
May be seen the sands among

Parched the flowers they bear along

Heresaid the Year
Apology for Her
Be rendered by the Bee
Herself without a Parliament
Apology for Me
Apparently with no surprise
To any happy flower
The frost beheads it at its play
In accidental power
The blond assassin passes on
The sun proceeds unmoved
To measure off another day
For an approving God
Arcturus is his other name
Id rather call him Star
Its very mean of Science
To go and interfere
I slew a worm the other day
A Savant passing by
Murmured ResurgamCentipede
Oh Lordhow frail are we
I pull a flower from the woods
A monster with a glass
Computes the stamens in a breath
And has her in a class
Whereas I took the Butterfly
Aforetime in my hat
He sits erect in Cabinets
The Clover bells forgot
What once was Heaven
Is Zenith now
Where I proposed to go
When Times brief masquerade was done
Is mapped and charted too
What if the poles should frisk about
And stand upon their heads
I hope Im ready for the worst
Whatever prank betides
Perhaps the Kingdom of Heavens changed
I hope the Children there Wont be new fashioned when I come
And laugh at meand stare
I hope the Father in the skies
Will lift his little girl
Old fashionednaughteverything
Over the stile of Pearl
Arcturus is his other name
Id rather call him Star
Its very mean of Science
To go and interfere

Over the stile of Pearl
Are Friends Delight or Pain
Could Bounty but remain
Riches were good
But if they only stay
Ampler to fly away
Riches are sad
Artists wrestled here
Lo a tint Cashmere
Lo a Rose
Student of the Year
For the easel here
Say Repose
As by the dead we love to sit
Become so wondrous dear
As for the lost we grapple
Tho all the rest are here
In broken mathematics
We estimate our prize
Vastin its fading ration
To our penurious eyes
As Children bid the Guest Good Night
And then reluctant turn
My flowers raise their pretty lips
Then put their nightgowns on
As children caper when they wake
Merry that it is Morn
My flowers from a hundred cribs
Will peep and prance again
As Everywhere of Silver
With Ropes of Sand
To keep it from effacing
The Track called Land
As far from pity as complaint
As cool to speechas stone
As numb to Revelation
As if my Trade were Bone
As far from timeas History
As near yourselfToday
As Children to the Rainbows scarf
Or Sunsets Yellow play
To eyelids in the Sepulchre
How dumb the Dancer lies
While Colors Revelations break
And blazethe Butterflies
As from the earth the light Balloon
Asks nothing but release
Ascension that for which it was
Its soaring Residence
The spirit looks upon the Dust
That fastened it so long
With indignation
As a Bird
Defrauded of its song
As Frost is best conceived
By force of its Result
Affliction is inferred
By subsequent effect
If when the sun reveal
The Garden keep the Gash
If as the Days resume
The wilted countenance
Cannot correct the crease
Or counteract the stain
Presumption is Vitality
Was somewhere put in twain
As if I asked a common Alms
And in my wondering hand
A Stranger pressed a Kingdom
And I bewildered stand
As if I asked the Orient
Had it for me a Morn
And it should lift its purple Dikes
And shatter me with Dawn
As if some little Arctic flower
Upon the polar hem
Went wandering down the Latitudes
Until it puzzled came
To continents of summer
To firmaments of sun
To strange bright crowds of flowers
And birds of foreign tongue
I say As if this little flower
To Eden wandered in
What then Why nothing
Only your inference therefrom
As if the Sea should part
And show a further Sea
And thata furtherand the Three
But a presumption be
Of Periods of Seas
Unvisited of Shores
Themselves the Verge of Seas to be
Eternityis Those
As imperceptibly as Grief
The Summer lapsed away
Too imperceptible at last
To seem like Perfidy
A Quietness distilled
As Twilight long begun
Or Nature spending with herself
Sequestered Afternoon
The Dusk drew earlier in
The Morning foreign shone
A courteous yet harrowing Grace
As Guest that would be gone
And thus without a Wing
Or service of a Keel
Our Summer made her light escape
Into the Beautiful
As old as Woe
How old is that
Some eighteen thousand years
As old as Bliss
How old is that
They are of equal years
Together chiefest they ard found
But seldom side by side
From neither of them tho he try
Can Human nature hide
As One does Sickness over
In convalescent Mind
His scrutiny of Chances
By blessed Health obscured
As One rewalks a Precipice
And whittles at the Twig
That held Him from Perdition
Sown sidewise in the Crag
A Custom of the Soul
Far after suffering
Identity to question
For evidencet has been
As plan for Noon and plan for Night
So differ Life and Death
In positive Prospective
The Foot upon the Earth
At Distance and Achievement strains
The Foot upon the Grave
Makes effort at conclusion
Assisted faint of Love
As Sleigh Bells seem in summer
Or Bees at Christmas show
So fairyso fictitious
The individuals do
Repealed from observation
A Party that we knew
More distant in an instant
Than Dawn in Timbuctoo
As subtle as tomorrow
That never came
A warrant a conviction
Yet but a name
As the Starved Maelstrom laps the Navies
As the Vulture teased
Forces the Broods in lonely Valleys
As the Tiger eased
By but a Crumb of Blood fasts Scarlet
Till he meet a Man
Dainty adorned with Veins and Tissues
And partakeshis Tongue
Cooled by the Morsel for a moment
Grows a fiercer thing
Till he esteem his Dates and Cocoa
A Nutrition mean
I of a finer Famine
Deem my Supper dry
For but a Berry of Domingo
And a Torrid Eye
As Watchers hang upon the East
As Beggars revel at a feast
By savory Fancy spread
As brooks in deserts babble sweet
On ear too far for the delight
Heaven beguiles the tired
As that same watcher when the East
Opens the lid of Amethyst
And lets the morning go
That Beggar when an honored Guest
Those thirsty lips to flagons pressed
Heaven to us if true
At last to be identified
At last the lamps upon thy side
The rest of Life to see
Past Midnight Past the Morning Star
Past Sunrise
Ah What leagues there were
Between our feet and Day
At leastto prayis leftis left
Oh Jesusin the Air
I know not which thy chamber is
Im knockingeverywhere
Thou settest Earthquake in the South
And Maelstrom in the Sea
Say Jesus Christ of Nazareth
Hast thou no Arm for Me
Autumnoverlooked my Knitting
Dyessaid Hehave I
Could disparage a Flamingo
Show Me themsaid I
CochinealI chosefor deeming
It resemble Thee
And the little BorderDusker
For resembling Me
Awake ye muses nine sing me a strain divine
Unwind the solemn twine and tie my Valentine
Oh the Earth was made for lovers for damsel and hopeless swain
For sighing and gentle whispering and unity made of twain
All things do go a courting in earth or sea or air
God hath made nothing single but thee in His world so fair
The bride and then the bridegroom the two and then the one
Adam and Eve his consort the moon and then the sun
The life doth prove the precept who obey shall happy be
Who will not serve the sovereign be hanged on fatal tree
The high do seek the lowly the great do seek the small
None cannot find who seeketh on this terrestrial ball
The bee doth court the flower the flower his suit receives
And they make merry wedding whose guests are hundred leaves
The wind doth woo the branches the branches they are won
And the father fond demandeth the maiden for his son
The storm doth walk the seashore humming a mournful tune
The wave with eye so pensive looketh to see the moon
Their spirits meet together they make their solemn vows
No more he singeth mournful her sadness she doth lose
The worm doth woo the mortal death claims a living bride
Night unto day is married morn unto eventide
Earth is a merry damsel and heaven a knight so true
And Earth is quite coquettish and beseemeth in vain to sue
Now to the application to the reading of the roll
To bringing thee to justice and marshalling thy soul
Thou art a human solo a being cold and lone
Wilt have no kind companion thou reapst what thou hast sown
Hast never silent hours and minutes all too long
And a deal of sad reflection and wailing instead of song
Theres Sarah and Eliza and Emeline so fair
And Harriet and Susan and she with curling hair
Thine eyes are sadly blinded but yet thou mayest see
Six true and comely maidens sitting upon the tree
Approach that tree with caution then up it boldly climb
And seize the one thou lovest nor care for space or time
Then bear her to the greenwood and build for her a bower
And give her what she asketh jewel or bird or flower
And bring the fife and trumpet and beat upon the drum
And bid the world Goodmorrow and go to glory home
Away from Home are some and I
An Emigrant to be
In a Metropolis of Homes
Is easy possibly
The Habit of a Foreign Sky
Wedifficultacquire
As Children who remain in Face
The more their Feet retire
Baffled for just a day or two
Embarrassednot afraid
Encounter in my garden
An unexpected Maid
She beckons and the woods start
She nods and all begin
Surely such a country
I was never in
Banish Air from Air
Divide Light if you dare
Theyll meet
While Cubes in a Drop
Or Pellets of Shape
Fit
Films cannot annul
Odors return whole
Force Flame
And with a Blonde push
Over your impotence
Flits Steam
Be Mine the Doom
Sufficient Fame
To perish in Her Hand
Beautybe not causedIt Is
Chase it and it ceases
Chase it not and it abides
Overtake the Creases
In the Meadowwhen the Wind
Runs his fingers thro it
Deity will see to it
That You never do it
Because I could not stop for Death
He kindly stopped for me
The Carriage held but just Ourselves
And Immortality
We slowly drove He knew no haste
And I had put away
My labor and my leisure too
For His Civility
We passed the School where Children strove
At Recess in the Ring
We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain
We passed the Setting Sun
Or rather He passed us
The Dews drew quivering and chill
For only Gossamer my Gown
My Tippet only Tulle
We paused before a House that seemed
A Swelling of the Ground
The Roof was scarcely visible
The Cornice in the Ground
Since then tis Centuries and yet
Feels shorter than the Day
I first surmised the Horses Heads
Were toward Eternity
Because the Bee may blameless hum
For Thee a Bee do I become
List even unto Me
Because the Flowers unafraid
May lift a look on thine a Maid
Alway a Flower would be
Nor Robins Robins need not hide
When Thou upon their Crypts intrude
So Wings bestow on Me
Or Petals or a Dower of Buzz
That Bee to ride or Flower of Furze
I that way worship Thee
The sky is low the clouds are mean
A travelling flake of snow
Across a barn or through a rut
Debates if it will go
A narrow wind complains all day
How some one treated him
Nature like us is sometimes caught
Without her diadem
Bee Im expecting you
Was saying Yesterday
To Somebody you know
That you were due
The Frogs got Home last Week
Are settled and at work
Birds mostly back
The Clover warm and thick
Youll get my Letter by
The seventeenth Reply
Or better be with me
Yours Fly
Before He comes we weigh the Time
Tis Heavy and tis Light
When He depart an Emptiness
Is the prevailing Freight
Before I got my eye put out
I liked as well to see
As other Creatures that have Eyes
And know no other way
But were it told to meToday
That I might have the sky
For mineI tell you that my Heart
Would split for size of me
The Meadowsmine
The Mountainsmine
All ForestsStintless Stars
As much of Noon as I could take
Between my finite eyes
The Motions of the Dipping Birds
The Mornings Amber Road
For mineto look at when I liked
The News would strike me dead
So saferguesswith just my soul
Upon the Window pane
Where other Creatures put their eyes
Incautiousof the Sun
Before the ice is in the pools
Before the skaters go
Or any check at nightfall
Is tarnished by the snow
Before the fields have finished
Before the Christmas tree
Wonder upon wonder
Will arrive to me
What we touch the hems of
On a summers day
What is only walking
Just a bridge away
That which sings sospeaks so
When theres no one here
Will the frock I wept in
Answer me to wear
Before you thought of spring
Except as a surmise
You see God bless his suddenness
A fellow in the skies
Of independent hues
A little weatherworn
Inspiriting habiliments
Of indigo and brown
With specimens of song
As if for you to choose
Discretion in the interval
With gay delays he goes
To some superior tree
Without a single leaf
And shouts for joy to nobody
But his seraphic self
Behind Medips Eternity
Before MeImmortality
Myselfthe Term between
Death but the Drift of Eastern Gray
Dissolving into Dawn away
Before the West begin
Tis Kingdomsafterwardthey say
In perfectpauseless Monarchy
Whose Princeis Son of None
HimselfHis Dateless Dynasty
HimselfHimself diversify
In Duplicate divine
Tis Miracle before Methen
Tis Miracle behindbetween
A Crescent in the Sea
With Midnight to the North of Her
And Midnight to the South of Her
And Maelstromin the Sky
Bereaved of all I went abroad
No less bereaved was I
Upon a New Peninsula
The Grave preceded me
Obtained my Lodgings ere myself
And when I sought my Bed
The Grave it was reposed upon
The Pillow for my Head
I waked to find it first awake
I roseIt followed me
I tried to drop it in the Crowd
To lose it in the Sea
In Cups of artificial Drowse
To steep its shape away
The Gravewas finishedbut the Spade
Remained in Memory
Bereavement in their death to feel
Whom We have never seen
A Vital Kinsmanship import
Our Soul and theirsbetween
For StrangerStrangers do not mourn
There be Immortal friends
Whom Death see firsttis news of this
That paralyze Ourselves
Who vital only to Our Thought
Such Presence bear away
In dyingtis as if Our Souls
Abscondedsuddenly
Besides the Autumn poets sing
A few prosaic days
A little this side of the snow
And that side of the Haze
A few incisive Mornings
A few Ascetic Eves
GoneMr Bryants Golden Rod
And Mr Thomsons sheaves
Still is the bustle in the Brook
Sealed are the spicy valves
Mesmeric fingers softly touch
The Eyes of many Elves
Perhaps a squirrel may remain
My sentiments to share
Grant me Oh Lord a sunny mind
Thy windy will to bear
Besides this May
We know
There is Another
How fair
Our Speculations of the Foreigner
Some know Him whom We knew
Sweet Wonder
A Nature be
Where Saints and our plain going Neighbor

To thinking of mankind

Between My Countryand the Others
There is a Sea
But Flowersnegotiate between us
As Ministry
A bird came down the walk
He did not know I saw
He bit an angleworm in halves
And ate the fellow raw
And then he drank a dew
From a convenient grass
And the hopped sideways to the wall
To let a beetle pass
He glanced with rapid eyes
That hurried all abroad
They looked like frightened beads I thought
He stirred his velvet head
Like one in danger cautious
I offered him a crumb
And he unrolled his feathers
And rolled him softer home
Then oars divide the ocean
Too silver for a seam
Or butterflies off banks of noon
Leap plashless as they swim
Blazing in Gold and quenching in Purple
Leaping like Leopards to the Sky
Then at the feet of the old Horizon
Laying her spotted Face to die
Stooping as low as the Otters Window
Touching the Roof and tinting the Barn
Kissing her Bonnet to the Meadow
And the Juggler of Day is gone
Bless God he went as soldiers
His musket on his breast
Grant God he charge the bravest
Of all the martial blest
Please God might I behold him
In epauletted white
I should not fear the foe then
I should not fear the fight
Bloom upon the Mountainstated
Blameless of a Name

Notching the fall of the Even Sun
Bring me the sunset in a cup
Reckon the mornings flagons up
And say how many Dew
Tell me how far the morning leaps
Tell me what time the weaver sleeps
Who spun the breadth of blue
Write me how many notes there be
In the new Robins ecstasy
Among astonished boughs
How many trips the Tortoise makes
How many cups the Bee partakes
The Debauchee of Dews
Also who laid the Rainbows piers
Also who leads the docile spheres
By withes of supple blue
Whose fingers string the stalactite
Who counts the wampum of the night
To see that none is due
Who built this little Alban House
And shut the windows down so close
My spirit cannot see
Wholl let me out some gala day
With implements to fly away
Passing Pomposity
But little Carmine hath her face
Of Emerald scanther Gown
Her Beautyis the love she doth
ItselfexhibitMinemd ash
By a flowerBy a letter
By a nimble love
If I weld the Rivet faster
Final fastabove
Never mind my breathless Anvil
Never mind Repose
Never mind the sooty faces
Tugging at the Forge
By Chivalries as tiny
A Blossom or a Book
The seeds of smiles are planted
Which blossom in the dark
By homely gift and hindered Words
The human heart is told
Of Nothing
Nothing is the force
That renovates the World
By my Window have I for Scenery
Just a Seawith a Stem
If the Bird and the Farmerdeem it a Pine
The Opinion will servefor them
It has no Port nor a Linebut the Jays
That split their route to the Sky
Or a Squirrel whose giddy Peninsula
May be easier reachedthis way
For Inlandsthe Earth is the under side
And the upper sideis the Sun
And its Commerceif Commerce it have
Of SpiceI infer from the Odors borne
Of its Voiceto affirmwhen the Wind is within
Can the Dumbdefine the Divine
The Definition of Melodyis
That Definition is none
Itsuggests to our Faith
Theysuggest to our Sight
When the latteris put away
I shall meet with Conviction I somewhere met
That Immortality
Was the Pine at my Window a Fellow
Of the Royal Infinity
Apprehensionsare Gods introductions
To be hallowedaccordingly
By such and such an offering
To Mr So and So
The web of live woven
So martyrs albums show
I started early took my dog
And visited the sea
The mermaids in the basement
Came out to look at me
And frigates in the upper floor
Extended hempen hands
Presuming me to be a mouse
Aground upon the sands
But no man moved me till the tide
Went past my simple shoe
And past my apron and my belt
And past my bodice too
And made as he would eat me up
As wholly as a dew
Upon a dandelions sleeve
And then I started too
And he he followed close behind
I felt his silver heel
Upon my ankle then my shoes
Would overflow with pearl
Until we met the solid town
No man he seemed to know
And bowing with a mighty look
At me the sea withdrew
I never saw a moor
I never saw the sea
Yet now I know how the heather looks
And what a wave must be
I never spoke with God
Nor visited in Heaven
Yet certain am I of the spot
As if the chart were given

Memoriesof Palm
Cannot be stifledwith Narcotic
Nor suppressedwith Balm
Cocoon above Cocoon below
Stealthy Cocoon why hide you so
What all the world suspect
An hour and gay on every tree
Your secret perched in ecstasy
Defies imprisonment
An hour in Chrysalis to pass
Then gay above receding grass
A Butterfly to go
A moment to interrogate
Then wiser than a Surrogate
The Universe to know

Theseare Times Affair

They emerge from His Obscuring
What Deathknows so well
Our minuter intuitions
Deem unplausible
Come slowly
Eden
Lips unused to thee
Bashful sip thy jasmines
As the fainting bee
Reaching late his flower
Round her chamber hums
Counts his nectars alights
And is lost in balms
Conjecturing a Climate
Of unsuspended Suns
Adds poignancy to Winter
The Shivering Fancy turns
To a fictitious Country
To palliate a Cold
Not obviated of Degree
Nor erasedof Latitude
Conscious am I in my Chamber
Of a shapeless friend
He doth not attest by Posture
Nor Confirmby Word
Neither Placeneed I present Him
Fitter Courtesy
Hospitable intuition
Of His Company
Presenceis His furthest license
Neither He to Me
Nor Myself to Himby Accent

Than Monotony

Neither if He visit Other

But Instinct esteem Him
Immortality
Could Hope inspect her Basis
Her Craft were done
Has a fictitious Charter
Or it has none
Balked in the vastest instance
But to renew
Felled by but one assassin
Prosperity
Could I but ride indefinite
As doth the Meadow Bee
And visit only where I liked
And No one visit me
And flirt all Day with Buttercups
And marry whom I may
And dwell a little everywhere
Or better run away
With no Police to follow
Or chase Him if He do
Till He should jump Peninsulas
To get away from me
I said But just to be a Bee
Upon a Raft of Air
And row in Nowhere all Day long
And anchor off the Bar
What Liberty So Captives deem
Who tight in Dungeons are
CouldI do morefor Thee
Wert Thou a Bumble Bee
Since for the Queen have I
Nought but Bouquet
Could Ithenshut the door
Lest my beseeching faceat last
Rejectedbeof Her
Could livedid live
Could diedid die
Could smile upon the whole
Through faith in one he met not
To introduce his soul
Could go from scene familiar
To an untraversed spot
Could contemplate the journey
With unpuzzled heart
Such trust had one among us
Among us not today
We who saw the launching
Never sailed the Bay
Could mortal lip divine
The undeveloped Freight
Of a delivered syllable
Twould crumble with the weight
Crisis is a Hair
Toward which the forces creep
Past which forces retrograde
If it come in sleep
To suspend the Breath
Is the most we can
Ignorant is it Life or Death
Nicely balancing
Let an instant push
Or an Atom press
Or a Circle hesitate
In Circumference
Itmay jolt the Hand
That adjusts the Hair
That secures Eternity
From presentingHere
Crumbling is not an instants Act
A fundamental pause
Dilapidations processes
Are organized Decays
Tis first a Cobweb on the Soul
A Cuticle of Dust
A Borer in the Axis
An Elemental Rust
Ruin is formalDevils work
Consecutive and slow
Fail in an instant no man did
Slippingis Crashs law
Dare you see a Soul at the White Heat
Then crouch within the door
Redis the Fires common tint
But when the vivid Ore
Has vanquished Flames conditions
It quivers from the Forge
Without a color but the light
Of unanointed Blaze
Least Village has its Blacksmith
Whose Anvils even ring
Stands symbol for the finer Forge
That soundless tugswithin
Refining these impatient Ores
With Hammer and with Blaze
Until the Designated Light
Repudiate the Forge
DEAR March come in
How glad I am
I looked for you before
Put down your hat
You must have walked
How out of breath you are
Dear March how are you
And the rest
Did you leave Nature well
Oh March come right upstairs with me
I have so much to tell

I got your letter and the birds
The maples never knew
That you were comingI declare
How red their faces grew
But March forgive me
And all those hills
You left for me to hue
There was no purple suitable
You took it all with you

Who knocks That April
Lock the door
I will not be pursued
He stayed away a year to call
When I am occupied
But trifles look so trivial
As soon as you have come
That blame is just as dear as praise
And praise as mere as blame
Death is a Dialogue between
The Spirit and the Dust
Dissolve says DeathThe Spirit Sir
I have another Trust
Death doubts itArgues from the Ground
The Spirit turns away
Just laying off for evidence
An Overcoat of Clay
Death is like the insect
Menacing the tree
Competent to kill it
But decoyed may be
Bait it with the balsam
Seek it with the saw
Baffle if it cost you
Everything you are
Then if it have burrowed
Out of reach of skill
Wring the tree and leave it
Tis the vermins will
Death is potential to that Man
Who diesand to his friend
Beyond thatunconspicuous
To Anyone but God
Of these TwoGod remembers
The longestfor the friend
Is integraland therefore
Itself dissolvedof God
Death leaves Us homesick who behind
Except that it is gone
Are ignorant of its Concern
As if it were not born
Through all their former Places we
Like Individuals go
Who something lost the seeking for
Is all thats left them now
Death sets a thing significant
The eye had hurried by
Except a perished creature
Entreat us tenderly
To ponder little workmanships
In crayon or in wool
With This was last her fingers did
Industrious until
The thimble weighed too heavy
The stitches stopped themselves
And then t was put among the dust
Upon the closet shelves
A book I have a friend gave
Whose pencil here and there
Had notched the place that pleased him
At rest his fingers are
Now when I read I read not
For interrupting tears
Obliterate the etchings
Too costly for repairs
Declaiming Waters none may dread
But Waters that are still
Are so for that most fatal cause
In Nature they are full
Defrauded I a Butterfly
The lawful Heirfor Thee
Delayed till she had ceased to know
Delayed till in its vest of snow
Her loving bosom lay
An hour behind the fleeting breath
Later by just an hour than Death
Oh lagging Yesterday
Could she have guessed that it would be
Could but a crier of the joy
Have climbed the distant hill
Had not the bliss so slow a pace
Who knows but this surrendered face
Were undefeated still
Oh if there may departing be
Any forgot by Victory
In her imperial round
Show them this meek appareled thing
That could not stop to be a king
Doubtful if it be crowned
Delight becomes pictorial
When viewed through pain
More fair because impossible
That any gain
The mountaln at a given distance
In amber lies
Approached the amber flits a little
And thats the skies
Delight is as the flight
Or in the Ratio of it
As the Schools would say
The Rainbows way
A Skein
Flung colored after Rain
Would suit as bright
Except that flight
Were Aliment
If it would last
I asked the East
When that Bent Stripe
Struck up my childish
Firmament
And I for glee
Took Rainbows as the common way
And empty Skies
The Eccentricity
And so with Lives
And so with Butterflies
Seen magicthrough the fright
That they will cheat the sight
And Dower latitudes far on
Some sudden morn
Our portionin the fashion
Done
Denialis the only fact
Perceived by the Denied
Whose Willa numb significance
The Day the Heaven died
And all the Earth strove common round
Without Delight or Beam
What Comfort was it Wisdomwas
The spoiler of Our Home
Departed to the judgment
A mighty afternoon
Great clouds like ushers leaning
Creation looking on
The flesh surrendered cancelled
The bodiless begun
Two worlds like audiences disperse
And leave the soul alone
Deprived of other Banquet
I entertained Myself
At firsta scant nutrition
An insufficient Loaf
But grown by slender addings
To so esteemed a size
Tis sumptuous enough for me
And almost to suffice
A Robins famine able
Red Pilgrim He and I
A Berry from our table
Reservefor charity
Despairs advantage is achieved
By sufferingDespair
To be assisted of Reverse
One must Reverse have bore
The Worthiness of Suffering like
The Worthiness of Death
Is ascertained by tasting
As can no other Mouth
Of Savorsmake us conscious
As did ourselves partake
Affliction feels impalpable
Until Ourselves are struck
Did Our Best Moment last
Twould supersede the Heaven
A fewand they by Riskprocure
So this Sortare not given
Except as stimulantsin
Cases of Despair
Or StuporThe Reserve
These Heavenly Moments are
A Grant of the Divine
That Certain as it Comes
Withdrawsand leaves the dazzled Soul
In her unfurnished Rooms
Did the Harebell loose her girdle
To the lover Bee
Would the Bee the Harebell hallow
Much as formerly
Did the Paradisepersuaded
Yi eld her moat of pearl
Would the Eden be an Eden
Or the Earlan Earl
Did we disobey Him
Just one time
Charged us to forget Him
But we couldnt learn
Were Himselfsuch a Dunce
What would wedo
Love the dull ladbest
Oh wouldnt you
Did you ever stand in a Caverns Mouth
Widths out of the Sun
And lookand shudder and block your breath
And deem to be alone
In such a place what horror
How Goblin it would be
And fly as twere pursuing you
Then Lonelinesslooks so
Did you ever look in a Cannons face
Between whose Yellow eye
And yoursthe Judgment intervened
The Question of To die
Extemporizing in your ear
As cool as Satyrs Drums
If you remember and were saved
Its liker soit seems
Distrustful of the Gentian
And just to turn away
The fluttering of her fringes
Child my perfidy
Weary for my
I will singing go
I shall not feel the sleetthen
I shall not fear the snow
Flees so the phantom meadow
Before the breathless Bee
So bubble brooks in deserts
On Ears that dying lie
Burn so the Evening Spires
To Eyes that Closing go
Hangs so distant Heaven
To a hand below
Do People moulder equally
They bury in the Grave
I do believe a Species
As positively live
As I who testify it
Deny that Iam dead
And fill my Lungs for Witness
From Tanksabove my Head
I say to you said Jesus
That there be standing here
A Sort that shall not taste of Death
If Jesus was sincere
I need no further Argue
That statement of the Lord
Is not a controvertible
He told me Death was dead
Dont put up my Thread and Needle
Ill begin to Sew
When the Birds begin to whistle
Better Stitchesso
These were bentmy sight got crooked
When my mindis plain
Ill do seamsa Queens endeavor
Would not blush to own
Hemstoo fine for Ladys tracing
To the sightless Knot
Tucksof dainty interspersion
Like a dotted Dot
Leave my Needle in the furrow
Where I put it down
I can make the zigzag stitches
Straightwhen I am strong
Till thendreaming I am sewing
Fetch the seam I missed
Closerso Iat my sleeping
Still surmise I stitch
Doom is the House without the Door
Tis entered from the Sun
And then the Ladders thrown away
Because Escapeis done
Tis varied by the Dream
Of what they do outside
Where Squirrels playand Berries die
And Hemlocksbowto God
Doubt Me My Dim Companion
Why God would be content
With but a fraction of the Life
Poured thee without a stint
The whole of meforever
What more the Woman can
Say quick that I may dower thee
With last Delight I own
It cannot be my Spirit
For that was thine before
I ceded all of Dust I knew
What Opulence the more
Had Ia freckled Maiden
Whose farthest of Degree
Wasthat she might
Some distant Heaven
Dwell timidly with thee
Sift her from Brow to Barefoot
Strain till your last Surmise
Drop like a Tapestry away
Before the Fires Eyes
Winnow her finest fondness
But hallow just the snow
Intact in Everlasting flake
Oh Caviler for you
Down Times quaint stream
Without an oar
We are enforced to sail
Our Port a secret
Our Perchance a Gale
What Skipper would
Incur the Risk
What Buccaneer would ride
Without a surety from the Wind
Or schedule of the Tide
Drab Habitation of Whom
Tabernacle or Tomb
Or Dome of Worm
Or Porch of Gnome
Or some Elfs Catacomb
Dramas Vitallest Expression is the Common Day
That arise and set about Us
Other Tragedy
Perish in the Recitation
Thisthe best enact
When the Audience is scattered
And the Boxes shut
Hamlet to Himself were Hamlet
Had not Shakespeare wrote
Though the Romeo left no Record
Of his Juliet
It were infinite enacted
In the Human Heart
Only Theatre recorded
Owner cannot shut
Dreamsare wellbut Wakings better
If One wake at morn
If One wake at Midnightbetter
Dreamingof the Dawn
Sweeterthe Surmising Robins
Never gladdened Tree
Than a Solid Dawnconfronting
Leading to no Day
Dropped into the Ether Acre
Wearing the Sod Gown
Bonnet of Everlasting Laces
Broochfrozen on
Horses of Blondeand Coach of Silver
Baggage a strapped Pearl
Journey of Downand Whip of Diamond
Riding to meet the Earl
Drowning is not so pitiful
As the attempt to rise
Three times t is said a sinking man
Comes up to face the skies
And then declines forever
To that abhorred abode

Where hope and he part company
For he is grasped of God
The Makers cordial visage
However good to see
Is shunned we must admit it
Like an adversity
Dust is the only Secret
Death the only One
You cannot find out all about
In his native town
Nobody know his Father
Never was a Boy
Hadnt any playmates
Or Early history
Industrious Laconic
Punctual Sedate
Bold as a Brigand
Stiller than a Fleet
Builds like a Bird too
Christ robs the Nest
Robin after Robin
Smuggled to Rest
Dying at my music
Bubble Bubble
Hold me till the Octaves run
Quick Burst the Windows
Ritardando
Phials left and the Sun
Dying Dying in the night
Wont somebody bring the light
So I can see which way to go
Into the everlasting snow
And Jesus Where is Jesus gone
They said that Jesusalways came
Perhaps he doesnt know the House
This way Jesus Let him pass
Somebody run to the great gate
And see if Dollies coming Wait
I hear her feet upon the stair
Death wont hurtnow Dollies here
Dying To be afraid of thee
One must to thine Artillery
Have left exposed a Friend
Than thine old Arrow is a Shot
Delivered straighter to the Heart
The leaving Love behind
Not for itself the Dust is shy
But enemy Beloved be
Thy Batteries divorce
Fight sternly in a Dying eye
Two Armies Love and Certainty
And Love and the Reverse
Each life converges to some centre
Expressed or still
Exists in every human nature
A goal
Admitted scarcely to itself it may be
Too fair
For credibilitys temerity
To dare
Adored with caution as a brittle heaven
To reach
Were hopeless as the rainbows raiment
To touch
Yet persevered toward surer for the distance
How high
Unto the saints slow diligence
The sky
Ungained it may be by a lifes low venture
But then
Eternity enables the endeavoring
Again
Each Scar Ill keep for Him
Instead Ill say of Gem
In His long Absence worn
A Costlier one
But every Tear I bore
Were He to count them oer
His own would fall so more
Ill mis sum them
Each Second is the last
Perhaps recalls the Man
Just measuring unconsciousness
The Sea and Spar between
To fail within a Chance
How terribler a thing
Than perish from the Chances list
Before the Perishing
Elysium is as far as to
The very nearest Room
If in that Room a Friend await
Felicity or Doom
What fortitude the Soul contains
That it can so endure
The accent of a coming Foot
The opening of a Door
No rack can torture me
My souls at liberty
Behind this mortal bone
There knits a bolder one

You cannot prick with saw
Nor rend with scymitar
Two bodies therefore be
Bind one and one will flee

The eagle of his nest
No easier divest
And gain the sky
Than mayest thou

Except thyself may be
Thine enemy
Captivity is consciousness
Sos liberty
Embarrassment of one another
And God
Is Revelations limit
Aloud
Is nothing that is chief
But still
Divinity dwells under a seal
Empty my Heart of Thee
Its single Artery
Begin and leave Thee out
Simply Extinctions Date
Much Billow hath the Sea
One BalticThey
Subtract Thyself in play
And not enough of me
Is leftto put away
Myself meanth Thee
Erase the Rootno Tree
Theethenno me
The Heavens stripped
Eternitys vast pocket picked
Ended ere it begun
The Title was scarcely told
When the Preface perished from Consciousness
The Story unrevealed
Had it been mine to print
Had it been yours to read
That it was not Our privilege
The interdict of God
Endow the Livingwith the Tears
You squander on the Dead
And They were Men and Womennow
Around Your Fireside
Instead of Passive Creatures
Denied the Cherishing
Till Theythe Cherishing deny
With Deaths Ethereal Scron
Escape is such a thankful Word
I often in the Night
Consider it unto myself
No spectacle in sight
Escape it is the Basket
In which the Heart is caught
When down some awful Battlement
The rest of Life is dropt
Tis not to sight the savior
It is to be the saved
And that is why I lay my Head
Upon this trusty word
Escaping backward to perceive
The Sea upon our place
Escaping forward to confront
His glittering Embrace
Retreating up a Billows height
Retreating blinded down
Our undermining feet to meet
Instructs to the Divine
Essential Oilsare wrung
The Attar from the Rose
Be not expressed by Sunsalone
It is the gift of Screws
The General Rosedecay
But thisin Ladys Drawer
Make SummerWhen the Lady lie
In Ceaseless Rosemary
Except the Heaven had come so near
So seemed to choose My Door
The Distance would not haunt me so
I had not hopedbefore
But just to hear the Grace depart
I never thought to see
Afflicts me with a Double loss
Tis lostand lost to me
Except to Heaven she is nought
Except for Angelslone
Except to some widewandering Bee
A flower superfluous blown
Except for windsprovincial
Except by Butterflies
Unnoticed as a single dew
That on the Acre lies
The smallest Housewife in the grass
Yet take her from the Lawn
And somebody has lost the face
That made ExistenceHome
The soul selects her own society
Then shuts the door
On her divine majority
Obtrude no more
Unmoved she notes the chariots pausing
At her low gate
Unmoved an emperor is kneeling
Upon her mat
Ive known her from an ample nation
Choose one
Then close the valves of her attention
Like stone
Exhilaration is the Breeze
That lifts us from the Ground
And leaves us in another place
Whose statement is not found
Returns us not but after time
We soberly descend
A little newer for the term
Upon Enchanted Ground
Exhilarationis within
There can no Outer Wine
So royally intoxicate
As that diviner Brand
The Soul achievesHerself
To drinkor set away
For VisitorOr Sacrament
Tis not of Holiday
To stimulate a Man
Who hath the Ample Rhine
Within his ClosetBest you can
Exhale in offering
Expectationis Contentment
GainSatiety
But SatietyConviction
Of Necessity
Of an Austere trait in Pleasure
Good without alarm
Is a too established Fortune
Dangerdeepens Sum
Experience is the Angled Road
Preferred against the Mind
ByParadoxthe Mind itself
Presuming it to lead
Quite OppositeHow Complicate
The Discipline of Man
Compelling Him to Choose Himself
His Preappointed Pain
Exultation is the going
Of an inland soul to sea
Past the housespast the headlands
Into deep Eternity
Bred as we among the mountains
Can the sailor understand
The divine intoxication
Of the first league out from land
Fairer through Fadingas the Day
Into the Darkness dips away
Half Her Complexion of the Sun
HinderingHauntingPerishing
Rall ies Her Glow like a dying Friend
Teasing with glittering Amend
Only to aggravate the Dark
Through an expiringperfectlook
Faith is a fine invention
When Gentlemen can see
But Microscopes are prudent
In an Emergency
Faith is a fine invention
When Gentlemen can see
But Microscopes are prudent
In an Emergency
Faithis the Pierless Bridge
Supporting what We see
Unto the Scene that We do not
Too slender for the eye
It bears the Soul as bold
As it were rocked in Steel
With Arms of Steel at either side
It joinsbehind the Veil
To what could We presume
The Bridge would cease to be
To Our far vacillating Feet
A first Necessity
Faithful to the end Amended
From the Heavenly Clause
Constancy with a Proviso
Constancy abhors
Crowns of Life are servile Prizes
To the stately Heart
Given for the Giving solely
No Emolument

Faithful to the end Amended
From the Heavenly clause
Lucrative indeed the offer
But the Heart withdraws
I will give the base Proviso
Spare Your Crown of Life
Those it fits too fair to wear it
Try it on Yourself
Fame is a bee
It has a song
It has a sting
Ah too it has a wing
Fame is a fickle food
Upon a shifting plate
Whose table once a
Guest but not
The second time is set
Whose crumbs the crows inspect
And with ironic caw
Flap past it to the Farmers Corn
Men eat of it and die
Fame is the tine that Scholars leave
Upon their Setting Names
The Iris not of Occident
That disappears as comes
Fame of Myself to justify
All other Plaudit be
SuperfluousAn Incense
Beyond Necessity
Fame of Myself to lackAlthough
My Name be else Supreme
This were an Honor honorless
A futile Diadem
FATE slew him but he did not drop
She felledhe did not fall
Impaled him on her fiercest stakes
He neutralized them all
She stung him sapped his firm advance
But when her worst was done
And he unmoved regarded her
Acknowledged him a man
Finding is the first Act
The second loss
Third Expedition for
The Golden Fleece
Fourth no Discovery
Fifth no Crew
Finally no Golden Fleece
Jasonshamtoo
Finiteto fail but infinite to Venture
For the one ship that struts the shore
Manys the gallantoverwhelmed Creature
Nodding in Navies nevermore
I dreaded that first robin so
But he is mastered now
And Im accustomed to him grown
He hurts a little though
I thought if I could only live
Till that first shout got by
Not all pianos in the woods
Had power to mangle me
I dared not meet the daffodils
For fear their yellow gown
Would pierce me with a fashion
So foreign to my own
I wished the grass would hurry
So when t was time to see
Hed be too tall the tallest one
Could stretch to look at me
I could not bear the bees should come
I wished theyd stay away
In those dim countries where they go
What word had they for me
Theyre here though not a creature failed
No blossom stayed away
In gentle deference to me
The Queen of Calvary
Each one salutes me as he goes
And I my childish plumes
Lift in bereaved acknowledgment
Of their unthinking drums
Fitter to see Him I may be
For the long HindranceGraceto Me
With Summers and with Winters grow

To make Me fairest of the Earth
The Waitingthenwill seem so worth

The blame that I was chosenthen

The turning oer and oer my face
For Evidence it be the Grace

FlowersWellif anybody
Can the ecstasy define
Half a transporthalf a trouble
With which flowers humble men
Anybody find the fountain
From which floods so contra flow
I will give him all the Daisies
Which upon the hillside blow
Too much pathos in their faces
For a simple breast like mine
Butterflies from St Domingo
Cruising round the purple line
Have a system of aesthetics
Far superior to mine
For Deathor rather
For the Things twould buy
Thisput away
Lifes Opportunity
The Things that Death will buy
Are Room
Escape from Circumstances
And a Name
With Gifts of Life
How Deaths Gifts may compare
We know not
For the Rateslie Here
For each ecstatic instant
We must an anguish pay
In keen and quivering ratio
To the ectasty
For each beloved hour
Sharp pittances of years
Bitter contested farthings
And coffers heaped with tears
For every Bird a Nest
Wherefore in timid quest
Some little Wren goes seeking round
Wherefore when boughs are free
Households in every tree
Pilgrim be found
Perhaps a home too high
Ah Aristocracy
The little Wren desires
Perhaps of twig so fine
Of twine een superfine
Her pride aspires
The Lark is not ashamed
To build upon the ground
Her modest house
Yet who of all the throng
Dancing around the sun
Does so rejoice
For largest Womans Hearth I knew
Tis little I can do
And yet the largest Womans Heart
Could hold an Arrowtoo
And so instructed by my own
I tenderer turn Me to
For thisaccepted Breath
Through itcompete with Death
The fellow cannot touch this Crown
By itmy title take
Ah what a royal sake
To my necessitystooped down
No Wildernesscan be
Where this attendeth me
No Desert Noon
No fear of frost to come
Haunt the perennial bloom
But Certain June
Get Gabrielto tellthe royal syllable
Get Saintswith newunsteady tongue
To say what trance below
Most like their glory show
Fittest the Crown
FORBIDDEN fruit a flavor has
That lawful orchards mocks
How luscious lies the pea within
The pod that Duty locks
Forever at His side to walk
The smaller of the two
Brain of His Brain
Blood of His Blood
Two livesOne Beingnow
Forever of His fate to taste
If griefthe largest part
If joyto put my piece away
For that beloved Heart
All lifeto know each other
Whom we can never learn
And bye and byea Change
Called Heaven
Rapt Neighborhoods of Men
Just finding outwhat puzzled us
Without the lexicon
Foreverit composed of Nows
Tis not a different time
Except for Infiniteness
And Latitude of Home
From thisexperienced Here
Remove the Datesto These
Let Months dissolve in further Months
And Yearsexhale in Years
Without Debateor Pause
Or Celebrated Days
No different Our Years would be
From Anno Dominis

Frequently the wood are pink
Frequently are brown
Frequently the hills undress
Behind my native town
Oft a head is crested
I was wont to see
And as oft a cranny
Where it used to be
And the Earth they tell me
On its Axis turned
Wonderful Rotation
By but twelve performed
From Blank to Blank
A Threadless Way
I pushed Mechanic feet
To stopor perishor advance
Alike indifferent
If end I gained
It ends beyond
Indefinite disclosed
I shut my eyesand groped as well
Twas lighterto be Blind
From Cocoon forth a Butterfly
As Lady from her Door
Emergeda Summer Afternoon
Repairing Everywhere
Without Designthat I could trace
Except to stray abroad
On Miscellaneous Enterprise
The Cloversunderstood
Her pretty Parasol be seen
Contracting in a Field
Where Men made Hay
Then struggling hard
With an opposing Cloud
Where PartiesPhantom as Herself
To Nowhereseemed to go
In purposeless Circumference
As twere a Tropic Show
And notwithstanding Beethat worked
And Flowerthat zealous blew
This Audience of Idleness
Disdained them from the Sky
Till Sundown crepta steady Tide
And Men that made the Hay
And Afternoonand Butterfly
Extinguishedin the Sea
My cocoon tightens colors tease
Im feeling for the air
A dim capacity for wings
Degrades the dress I wear

A power of butterfly must be
The aptitude to fly
Meadows of majesty concedes
And easy sweeps of sky

So I must baffle at the hint
And cipher at the sign
And make much blunder if at last
I take the clew divine
From Us She wandered now a Year
Her tarrying unknown
If Wilderness prevent her feet
Or that Ethereal Zone
No eye hath seen and lived
We ignorant must be
We only know what time of Year
We took the Mystery
Funnyto be a Century
And see the Peoplegoing by
Ishould die of the Oddity
But thenIm not so staidas He
He keeps His Secrets safelyvery
Were He to tellextremely sorry
This Bashful Globe of Ours would be
So dainty of Publicity
Further in Summer than the Birds
Pathetic from the Grass
A minor Nation celebrates
Its unobtrusive Mass
No Ordinance be seen
So gradual the Grace
A pensive Custom it becomes
Enlarging Loneliness
Antiquest felt at Noon
When August burning low
Arise this spectral Canticle
Repose to typify
Remit as yet no Grace
No Furrow on the Glow
Yet a Druidic Difference
Enhances Nature now

Of soul or sword

Nature in charity

But make no syllablelike Death

Glory is that bright tragic thing
That for an instant
Means Dominion
Warms some poor name
That never felt the Sun
Gently replacing
In oblivion
Glowing is her Bonnet
Glowing is her Cheek
Glowing is her Kirtle
Yet she cannot speak
Better as the Daisy
From the Summer hill
Vanish unrecorded
Save by tearful rill
Save by loving sunrise
Looking for her face
Save by feet unnumbered
Pausing at the place
God gave a loaf to every bird
But just a crumb to me
I dare not eat it though I starve
My poignant luxury
To own it touch it prove the feat
That made the pellet mine
Too happy in my sparrow chance
For ampler coveting
It might be famine all around
I could not miss an ear
Such plenty smiles upon my board
My garner shows so fair
I wonder how the rich may feel
An Indiamanan Earl
I deem that I with but a crumb
Am sovereign of them all
God is a distantstately Lover
Woos as He states usby His Son
Verily a Vicarious Courtship
Miles and Priscilla were such an One
But lest the Soullike fair Priscilla
Choose the Envoyand spurn the Groom
Vouches with hyperbolic archness
Miles and John Alden were Synonym
God made a little Gentian
It triedto be a Rose
And failedand all the Summer laughed
But just before the Snows
There rose a Purple Creature
That ravished all the Hill
And Summer hid her Forehead
And Mockerywas still
The Frosts were her condition
The Tyrian would not come
Until the Northinvoke it
CreatorShall Ibloom
God permit industrious angels
Afternoons to play
I met one forgot my schoolmates
All for him straightaway
God calls home the angels promptly
At the setting sun
I missed mine How dreary marbles
After playing the Crown
Going to Heaven
I dont know when
Pray do not ask me how
Indeed Im too astonished
To think of answering you
Going to Heaven
How dim it sounds
And yet it will be done
As sure as flocks go home at night
Unto the Shepherds arm
Perhaps youre going too
Who knows
If you should get there first
Save just a little space for me
Close to the two I lost
The smallest Robe will fit me
And just a bit of Crown
For you know we do not mind our dress
When we are going home
Im glad I dont believe it
For it would stop my breath
And Id like to look a little more
At such a curious Earth
Im glad they did believe it
Whom I have never found
Since the might Autumn afternoon
I left them in the ground
Going to him Happy letter Tell him
Tell him the page I didnt write
Tell him I only said the syntax
And left the verb and the pronoun out
Tell him just how the fingers hurried
Then how they waded slow slow slow
And then you wished you had eyes in your pages
So you could see what moved them so
Tell him it wasnt a practised writer
You guessed from the way the sentence toiled
You could hear the bodice tug behind you
As if it held but the might of a child
You almost pitied it you it worked so
Tell himNo you may quibble there
For it would split his heart to know it
And then you and I were silenter
Tell him night finished before we finished
And the old clock kept neighing day
And you got sleepy and begged to be ended
What could it hinder so to say
Tell him just how she sealed you cautious
But if he ask where you are hid
Until tomorrowhappy letter
Gesture coquette and shake your head
Good MorningMidnight
Im coming Home
Daygot tired of Me
How could Iof Him
Sunshine was a sweet place
I liked to stay
But Morndidnt want menow
SoGoodnightDay
I can lookcant I
When the East is Red
The Hillshave a waythen
That puts the Heartabroad
Youare not so fairMidnight
I choseDay
Butplease take a little Girl
He turned away
Good night because we must
How intricate the dust
I would go to know
Oh incognito
Saucy Saucy Seraph
To elude me so
Father they wont tell me
Wont you tell them to
Good night which put the candle out
A jealous zephyr not a doubt
Ah friend you little knew
How long at that celestial wick
The angels labored diligent
Extinguished now for you
It might have been the lighthouse spark
Some sailor rowing in the dark
Had importuned to see
It might have been the waning lamp
That lit the drummer from the camp
To purer reveille
Good to hide and hear em hunt
Better to be found
If one care to that is
The Fox fits the Hound
Good to know and not tell
Best to know and tell
Can one find the rare Ear
Not too dull
Gratitudeis not the mention
Of a Tenderness
But its still appreciation
Out of Plumb of Speech
When the Sea return no Answer
By the Line and Lead
Proves it theres no Sea or rather
A remoter Bed
Great Caesar Condescend
The Daisy to receive
Gathered by Catos Daughter
With your majestic leave
Grief is a Mouse
And chooses Wainscot in the Breast
For His Shy House
And baffles quest
Grief is a Thiefquick startled
Pricks His Earreport to hear
Of that Vast Dark
That swept His Beingback
Grief is a Jugglerboldest at the Play
Lest if He flinchthe eye that way
Pounce on His BruisesOnesayor Three
Grief is a Gourmandspare His luxury
Best Grief is Tonguelessbefore Hell tell
Burn Him in the Public Square
His Asheswill
Possiblyif they refuseHow then know
Since a Rack couldnt coax a syllablenow
Growth of Man like Growth of Nature
Gravitates within
Atmosphere and Sun endorse it
Bit it stir alone
Each its difficult Ideal
Must achieve Itself
Through the solitary prowess
Of a Silent Life
Effort is the sole condition
Patience of Itself
Patience of opposing forces
And intact Belief
Looking on is the Department
Of its Audience
But Transaction is assisted
By no Countenance
Had I not This or This I said
Appealing to Myself
In moment of prosperity
Inadequatewere Life
Thou hast not Me nor Meit said
In Moment of Reverse
And yet Thou art industrious
No needhadst Thouof us
My needwas all I hadI said
The need did not reduce
Because the foodexterminate
The hungerdoes not cease
But diligenceis sharper
Proportioned to the Chance
To feed upon the Retrograde
Enfeeblesthe Advance
Had I presumed to hope
The loss had been to Me
A Valuefor the Greatness Sake
As Giantsgone away
Had I presumed to gain
A Favor so remote
The failure but confirm the Grace
In further Infinite
Tis failurenot of Hope
But Confident Despair
Advancing on Celestial Lists
With faintTerrestial power
Tis Honorthough I die
For That no Man obtain
Till He be justified by Death
Thisis the Second Gain
Had we our senses
But perhaps tis well theyre not at Home
So intimate with Madness
Hes liable with them
Had we the eyes without our Head
How well that we are Blind
We could not look upon the Earth
So utterly unmoved
Have any like Myself
Investigating March
New Houses on the Hill descried
And possibly a Church
That were not We are sure
As lately as the Snow
And are Todayif We exist
Though how may this be so
Have any like Myself
Conjectured Who may be
The Occupants of the Adobes
So easy to the Sky
Twould seem that God should be
The nearest Neighbor to
And Heavena convenient Grace
For Show or Company
Have any like Myself
Preserved the Charm secure
By shunning carefully the Place
All Seasons of the Year
Excepting MarchTis then
My Villages be seen
And possibly a Steeple
Not afterwardby Men
Have you got a Brook in your little heart
Where bashful flowers blow
And blushing birds go down to drink
And shadows tremble so
And nobody knows so still it flows
That any brook is there
And yet your little draught of life
Is daily drunken there
Why look out for the little brook in March
When the rivers overflow
And the snows come hurrying from the fills
And the bridges often go
And later in August it may be
When the meadows parching lie
Beware lest this little brook of life
Some burning noon go dry
He ate and drank the precious Words
His Spirit grew robust
He knew no more that he was poor
Nor that his frame was Dust
He danced along the dingy Days
And this Bequest of Wings
Was but a Book What Liberty
A loosened spirit brings
He forgotand Iremembered
Twas an everyday affair
Long ago as Christ and Peter
Warmed them at the Temple fire
Thou wert with himquoth the Damsel
Nosaid Peter twasnt me
Jesus merely looked at Peter
Could I do aught elseto Thee
He fought like those Whove nought to lose
Bestowed Himself to Balls
As One who for a further Life
Had not a further Use
Invited Deathwith bold attempt
But Death was Coy of Him
As Other Men were Coy of Death
To Himto livewas Doom
His Comrades shifted like the Flakes
When Gusts reverse the Snow
But Hewas left alive Because
Of Greediness to die
He found my Beingset it up
Adjusted it to place
Then carved his nameupon it
And bade it to the East
Be faithfulin his absence
And he would come again
With Equipage of Amber
That timeto take it Home
He fumbles at your Soul
As Players at the Keys
Before they drop full Music on
He stuns you by degrees
Prepares your brittle Nature
For the Ethereal Blow
By fainter Hammersfurther heard
Then nearerThen so slow
Your Breath has time to straighten
Your Brainto bubble Cool
DealsOneimperialmda shThunderbolt
That scalps your naked Soul
When Winds take Forests in the Paws
The Universeis still
He fumbles at your spirit
As players at the keys
Before they drop full music on
He stuns you by degrees
Prepares your brittle substance
For the ethereal blow
By fainter hammers further heard
Then nearer then so slow
Your breath has time to straighten
Your brain to bubble cool
Deals one imperial thunderbolt
That scalps your naked soul
He gave away his Life
To UsGigantic Sum
A triflein his own esteem
But magnifiedby Fame
Until it burst the Hearts
That fancied they could hold
When swift it slipped its limit
And on the Heavensunrolled
Tis Oursto winceand weep
And wonderand decay
By Blossoms gradual process
He choseMaturity
And quickeningas we sowed
Just obviated Bud
And when We turned to note the Growth
Brokeperfectfrom the Pod
He outstripped Time with but a Bout
He outstripped Stars and Sun
And then unjaded challenged God
In presence of the Throne
And He and He in mighty List
Unto this present run
The larger Glory for the less
A just sufficient Ring
He parts Himselflike Leaves
And thenHe closes up
Then stands upon the Bonnet
Of Any Buttercup
And then He runs against
And oversets a Rose
And then does Nothing
Then away upon a JibHe goes
And dangles like a Mote
Suspended in the Noon
Uncertainto return Below
Or settle in the Moon
What come of Himat Night
The privilege to say
Be limited by Ignorance
What come of HimThat Day
The Frostpossess the World
In Cabinetsbe shown
A Sepulchre of quaintest Floss
An Abbeya Cocoon
He preached upon Breadth till it argued him narrow
The Broad are too broad to define
And of Truth until it proclaimed him a Liar
The Truth never flaunted a Sign
Simplicity fled from his counterfeit presence
As Gold the Pyrites would shun
What confusion would cover the innocent Jesus
To meet so enabled a Man
He put the Belt around my life
I heard the Buckle snap
And turned away imperial
My Lifetime folding up
Deliberate as a Duke would do
A Kingdoms Title Deed
Henceforth a Dedicated sort
A Member of the Cloud
Yet not too far to come at call
And do the little Toils
That make the Circuit of the Rest
And deal occasional smiles
To lives that stoop to notice mine
And kindly ask it in
Whose invitation know you not
For Whom I must decline
He strained my faith
Did he find it supple
Shook my strong trust
Did it thenyield
Hurled my belief
Butdid he shatterit
Rackedwith suspense
Not a nerve failed
Wrung mewith Anguish
But I never doubted him
Tho for what wrong
He did never say
Stabbedwhile I sued
His sweet forgiveness
Jesusits your little John
Dont you knowme
He told a homely tale
And spotted it with tears
Upon his infant face was set
The Cicatrice of years
All crumpled was the cheek
No other kiss had known
Than flake of snow divided with
The Redbreast of the Barn
If Motherin the Grave
Or Fatheron the Sea
Or Father in the Firmament
Or Brethren had he
If Commonwealth below
Or Commonwealth above
Have missed a Barefoot Citizen
Ive ransomed italive
He touched me so I live to know
That such a day permitted so
I groped upon his breast
It was a boundless place to me
And silenced as the awful sea
Puts minor streams to rest
And now Im different from before
As if I breathed superior air
Or brushed a Royal Gown
My feet too that had wandered so
My Gypsy facetransfigured now
To tenderer Renown
Into this Port if I might come
Rebecca to Jerusalem
Would not so ravished turn
Nor Persian baffled at her shrine
Lift such a Crucifixial sign
To her imperial Sun
He was weak and I was strongthen
So He let me lead him in
I was weak and He was strong then
So I let him lead meHome
Twasnt farthe door was near
Twasnt darkfor He wenttoo
Twasnt loud for He said nought
That was all I cared to know
Day knockedand we must part
Neitherwas strongestnow
He stroveand I strovetoo
We didnt do ittho
He who in Himself believes
Fraud cannot presume
Faith is Constancys Result
And assumesfrom Home
Cannot perish though it fail
Every second time
But defaced Vicariously
For Some Other Shame
Heart not so heavy as mine
Wending late home
As it passed my window
Whistled itself a tune
A careless snatcha balladA ditty of the street
Yet to my irritated Ear
An Anodyne so sweet
It was as if a Bobolink
Sauntering this way
Carolled and paused and carolled
Then bubbled slow away
It was as if a chirping brook
Upon a dusty way
Set bleeding feet to minuets
Without the knowing why
Tomorrow night will come again
Perhaps weary and sore
Ah Bugle By my window
I pray you pass once more
Heart we will forget him
You and I tonight
You must forget the warmth he gave
I will forget the light
When you have done pray tell me
Then I my thoughts will dim
Haste ‘lest while you’re lagging
I may remember him
Heaven has different Signsto me
Sometimes I think that Noon
Is but a symbol of the Place
And when again at Dawn
A mighty look runs round the World
And settles in the Hills
An Awe if it should be like that
Upon the Ignorance steals
The Orchard when the Sun is on
The Triumph of the Birds
When they together Victory make
Some Carnivals of Clouds
The Rapture of a finished Day
Returning to the West
All theseremind us of the place
That Men call paradise
Itself be fairerwe suppose
But how Ourself shall be
Adorned for a Superior Grace
Not yet our eyes can see
Heaven has different Signsto me
Sometimes I think that Noon

And when again at Dawn

Heaven is so far of the Mind
That were the Mind dissolved
The Siteof itby Architect
Could not again be proved
Tis vastas our Capacity
As fairas our idea
To Him of adequate desire
No further tis than Here
Heavenis what I cannot reach
The Apple on the Tree

The supreme iniquity
Fashioned by thy candid Hand
In a moment contraband
Though to trust us seems to us
More respectful We are Dust
We apologize to thee
For thine own Duplicity
Her breast is fit for pearls
But I was not a Diver
Her brow is fit for thrones
But I have not a crest
Her heart is fit for home
Ia Sparrowbuild there
Sweet of twigs and twine
My perennial nest
Her final summer was it
And yet we guessed it not
If tenderer industriousness
Pervaded her we thought
A further force of life
Developed from within
When Death lit all the shortness up
And made the hurry plain
We wondered at our blindness
When nothing was to see
But her Carrara guidepost
At our stupidity
When duller than our dulness
The busy darling lay
So busy was she finishing
So leisurely were we
Her Grace is all she has
And that so least displays
One Art to recognize must be
Another Art to praise

The Dimples ran along
And still it hurt you as some Bird

Then recollect a Ball she got

Her Sweet turn to leave the Homestead

Suffocatewith easy woe
What and if Ourself a Bridegroom
Put Her downin Italy
Herein a Blossom lies
A Sepulchre between
Cross it and overcome the Bee
Remaintis but a Rind
High from the earth I heard a bird
He trod upon the trees
As he esteemed them trifles
And then he spied a breeze
And situated softly
Upon a pile of wind
Which in a perturbation
Nature had left behind
A joyousgoing fellow
I gathered from his talk
Which both of benediction
And badinage partook
Without apparent burden
I learned in leafy wood
He was the faithful father
Of a dependent brood
And this untoward transport
His remedy for care
A contrast to our respites
How different we are
His Bill an Auger is
His Head a Cap and Frill
He laboreth at every Tree
A Worm His utmost Goal
His Feet are shod with Gauze
His Helmet is of Gold
His Breast a Single Onyx
With Chrysophrase inlaid
His Labor is a Chant
His Idlenessa Tune
Oh for a Bees experience
Of Clovers and of Noon
His Heart was darker than the starless night
For that there is a morn
But in this black Receptacle
Can be no Bode of Dawn
His voice decrepit was with Joy
Her words did totter so
How old the News of Love must be
To make Lips elderly
That purled a moment since with Glee
Is it Delight or Woe
Or Terror that do decorate
This livid interview
Years I had been from home
And now before the door
I dared not open lest a face
I never saw before
Stare vacant into mine
And ask my business there
My business just a life I left
Was such still dwelling there
I fumbled at my nerve
I scanned the windows near
The silence like an ocean rolled
And broke against my ear
I laughed a wooden laugh
That I could fear a door
Who danger and the dead had faced
But never quaked before
I fitted to the latch
My hand with trembling care
Lest back the awful door should spring
And leave me standing there
I moved my fingers off
As cautiously as glass
And held my ears and like a thief
Fled gasping from the house
Hope is a strange invention
A Patent of the Heart
In unremitting action
Yet never wearing out
Of this electric Adjunct
Not anything is known
But its unique momentum
Embellish all we own
Hope is the thing with feathers
That perches in the soul
And sings the tune without the words
And never stopsat all
And sweetestin the Galeis heard
And sore must be the storm
That could abash the little Bird
That kept so many warm
Ive heard it in the chillest land
And on the strangest Sea
Yet never in Extremity
It asked a crumbof Me
Housesso the Wise Men tell me
Mansions Mansions must be warm
Mansions cannot let the tears in
Mansions must exclude the storm
Many Mansions by his Father
I dont know him snugly built
Could the Children find the way there
Some would even trudge tonight
Housesso the Wise Men tell me
Mansions Mansions must be warm
Mansions cannot let the tears in
Mansions must exclude the storm
Many Mansions by his Father
I dont know him snugly built
Could the Children find the way there
Some would even trudge tonight
How far is it to Heaven
As far as Death this way
Of River or of Ridge beyond
Was no discovery
How far is it to Hell
As far as Death this way
How far left hand the Sepulchre
Defies Topography
How firm Eternity must look
To crumbling men like me
The only Adamant Estate
In all Identity
How mighty to the insecure
Thy Physiognomy
To whom not any Face cohere
Unless concealed in thee
How fits his Umber Coat
The Tailor of the Nut
Combined without a seam
Like Raiment of a Dream
Who spun the Auburn Cloth
Computed how the girth
The Chestnut aged grows
In those primeval Clothes
We know that we are wise
Accomplished in Surprise
Yet by this Countryman
This nature how undone
How fortunate the Grave
All Prizes to obtain
Successful certain if at last
First Suitor not in vain
How happy I was if I could forget
To remember how sad I am
Would be an easy adversity
But the recollecting of Bloom
Keeps making November difficult
Till I who was almost bold
Lose my way like a little Child
And perish of the cold
How happy is the little Stone
That rambles in the Road alone
And doesnt care about Careers
And Exigencies never fears
Whose Coat of elemental Brown
A passing Universe put on
And independent as the Sun
Associates or glows alone
Fulfilling absolute Decree
In casual simplicity
How Human Nature dotes
On what it cant detect
The moment that a Plot is plumbed
Prospective is extinct
Prospective is the friend
Reserved for us to know
When Constancy is clarified
Of Curiosity
Of subjects that resist
Redoubtablest is this
Where go we
Go we anywhere
Creation after this
How lonesome the Wind must feel Nights
When people have put out the Lights
And everything that has an Inn
Closes the shutter and goes in
How pompous the Wind must feel Noons
Stepping to incorporeal Tunes
Correcting errors of the sky
And clarifying scenery
How mighty the Wind must feel Morns
Encamping on a thousand dawns
Espousing each and spurning all
Then soaring to his Temple Tall
How many Flowers fail in Wood
Or perish from the Hill
Without the privilege to know
That they are Beautiful
How many cast a nameless Pod
Upon the nearest Breeze
Unconscious of the Scarlet Freight
It bear to Other Eyes
How many times these low feet staggered
Only the soldered mouth can tell
Trycan you stir the awful rivet
Trycan you lift the hasps of steel
Stroke the cool foreheadhot so often
Liftif you carethe listless hair
Handle the adamantine fingers
Never a thimblemoreshall wear
Buzz the dull flieson the chamber window
Braveshines the sun through the freckled pane
Fearlessthe cobweb swings from the ceiling
Indolent Housewifein Daisieslain
How noteless Men and Pleiads stand
Until a sudden sky
Reveals the fact that One is rapt
Forever from the Eye
Members of the Invisible
Existing while we stare
In Leagueless Opportunity
Oertakenless as the Air
Why didnt we detain Them
The Heavens with a smile
Sweep by our disappointed Heads
Without a syllable
How sickto waitin any placebut thine
I knew last nightwhen someone tried to twine
Thinkingperhapsthat I looked tiredor alone
Or breakingalmostwith unspoken pain
And I turnedducal
That rightwas thine
One portsufficesfor a Briglike mine
Ours be the tossingwild though the sea
Rather than a Mooringunshared by thee
Ours be the Cargounladedhere
Rather than the spicy isles
And thounot there
How slow the Wind
how slow the sea
how late their Fathers be
How the old Mountains drip with Sunset
How the Hemlocks burn
How the Dun Brake is draped in Cinder
By the Wizard Sun
How the old Steeples hand the Scarlet
Till the Ball is full
Have I the lip of the Flamingo
That I dare to tell
Then how the Fire ebbs like Billows
Touching all the Grass
With a departingSapphirefeature
As a Duchess passed
How a small Dusk crawls on the Village
Till the Houses blot
And the odd Flambeau no men carry
Glimmer on the Street
How it is Nightin Nest and Kennel
And where was the Wood
Just a Dome of Abyss is Bowing
Into Solitude
These are the Visions flitted Guido
Titiannever told
Domenichino dropped his pencil
Paralyzed with Gold
How the Waters closed above Him
We shall never know
How He stretched His Anguish to us
Thatis covered too
Spreads the Pond Her Base of Lilies
Bold above the Boy
Whose unclaimed Hat and Jacket
Sum the History
How well I knew Her not
Whom not to know has been
A Bounty in prospective now
Next Door to mine the Pain
I am afraid to own a Body
I am afraid to own a Soul
Profound precarious Property
Possession not optional
Double Estate entailed at pleasure
Upon an unsuspecting Heir
Duke in a moment of Deathlessness
And God for a Frontier
I am aliveI guess
The Branches on my Hand
Are full of Morning Glory
And at my fingers end
The Carminetingles warm
And if I hold a Glass
Across my Mouthit blurs it
Physiciansproof of Breath
I am alivebecause
I am not in a Room
The ParlorCommonlyit is
So Visitors may come
And leanand view it sidewise
And add How coldit grew
And Was it consciouswhen it stepped
In Immortality 
I am alivebecause
I do not own a House
Entitled to myselfprecise
And fitting no one else
And marked my Girlhoods name
So Visitors may know
Which Door is mineand not
I am ashamedI hide
What right have Ito be a Bride
So late a Dowerless Girl
Nowhere to hide my dazzled Face
No one to teach me that new Grace
Nor introducemy Soul
Me to adornHowtell
Trinketto make Me beautiful
Fabrics of Cashmere
Never a Gown of Dunmore
Raiment insteadof Pompadour
For MeMy soulto wear
Fingersto frame my Round Hair
Ovalas Feudal Ladies wore
Far FashionsFair
Skill to hold my Brow like an Earl
Pleadlike a Whippoorwill
Provelike a Pearl
Then for Character
Fashion My Spirit quaintwhite
Quicklike a Liquor
Gaylike Light
Bring Me my best Pride
No more ashamed
No more to hide
Meeklet it betoo proudfor Pride
Baptizedthis Daya Bride
I asked no other thing
No otherwas denied
I offered Beingfor it
The Mighty Merchant sneered
Brazil He twirled a Button
Without a glance my way
ButMadamis there nothing else
That We can showToday
I bet with every Wind that blew
Till Nature in chagrin
Employed a Fact to visit me
And scuttle my Balloon
I breathed enough to learn the trick
And now removed from air
I simulate the breath so well
That one to be quite sure
The lungs are stirless must descend
Among the cunning cells
And touch the pantomime himself
How cool the bellows feels
I bring an unaccustomed wine
To lips long parching
Next to mine
And summon them to drink
Crackling with fever they Essay
I turn my brimming eyes away
And come next hour to look
The hands still hug the tardy glass
The lips I would have cooled alas
Are so superfluous Cold
I would as soon attempt to warm
The bosoms where the frost has lain
Ages beneath the mould
Some other thirsty there may be
To whom this would have pointed me
Had it remained to speak
And so I always bear the cup
If haply mine may be the drop
Some pilgrim thirst to slake
If haply any say to me
Unto the little unto me
When I at last awake
I Came to buy a smiletoday
But just a single smile
The smallest one upon your face
Will suit me just as well
The one that no one else would miss
It shone so very small
Im pleading at the countersir
Could you afford to sell
Ive Diamondson my fingers
You know what Diamonds are
Ive Rubieslive the Evening Blood
And Topazlike the star
Twould be a Bargain for a Jew
Saymay I have itSir
I cant tell youbut you feel it
Nor can you tell me
Saints with ravished slate and pencil
Solve our April Day
Sweeter than a vanished frolic
From a vanished green
Swifter than the hoofs of Horsemen
Round a Ledge of dream
Modest let us walk among it
With our faces veiled
As they say polite Archangels
Do in meeting God
Not for meto prate about it
Not for youto say
To some fashionable Lady
Charming April Day
RatherHeavens Peter Parley
By which Children slow
To sublimer Recitation
Are prepared to go
I can wade Grief
Whole Pools of it
Im used to that
But the least push of Joy
Breaks up my feet
And I tipdrunken
Let no Pebblesmile
Twas the New Liquor
That was all
Power is only Pain
Stranded thro Discipline
Till Weightswill hang
Give Balmto Giants
And theyll wilt like Men
Give Himmaleh
Theyll CarryHim
I cannot be ashamed
Because I cannot see
The love you offer
Magnitude
Reverses Modesty
And I cannot be proud
Because a Height so high
Involves Alpine
Requirements
And Services of Snow
I cannot buy ittis not sold
There is no other in the World
Mine was the only one
I was so happy I forgot
To shut the Door And it went out
And I am all alone
If I could find it Anywhere
I would not mind the journey there
Though it took all my store
But just to look it in the Eye
Didst thou Thou didst not mean to say
Then turn my Face away
I cannot dance upon my Toes
No Man instructed me
But oftentimes among my mind
A Glee possesseth me
That had I Ballet knowledge
Would put itself abroad
In Pirouette to blanch a Troupe
Or lay a Prima mad
And though I had no Gown of Gauze
No Ringlet to my Hair
Nor hopped to Audienceslike Birds
One Claw upon the Air
Nor tossed my shape in Eider Balls
Nor rolled on wheels of snow
Till I was out of sight in sound
The House encore me so
Nor any know I know the Art
I mentioneasyHere
Nor any Placard boast me
Its full as Opera
I cannot live with You
It would be Life
And Life is over there
Behind the Shelf
The Sexton keeps the Key to
Putting up
Our LifeHis Porcelain
Like a Cup
Discarded of the Housewife
Quaintor Broke
A newer Sevres pleases
Old Ones crack
I could not diewith You
For One must wait
To shut the Others Gaze down
Youcould not
And Icould I stand by
And see Youfreeze
Without my Right of Frost
Deaths privilege
Nor could I risewith You
Because Your Face
Would put out Jesus
That New Grace
Glow plainand foreign
On my homesick Eye
Except that You than He
Shone closer by
Theyd judge UsHow
For Youserved HeavenYou know
Or sought to
I could not
Because You saturated Sight
And I had no more Eyes
For sordid excellence
As Paradise
And were You lost I would be
Though My Name
Rang loudest
On the Heavenly fame
And were Yousaved
And Icondemned to be
Where You were not
That selfwere Hell to Me
So We must meet apart
You thereIhere
With just the Door ajar
That Oceans areand Prayer
And that White Sustenance
Despair
I cautious scanned my little life
I winnowed what would fade
From what would last till Heads like mine
Should be adreaming laid
I put the latter in a Barn
The former blew away
I went one winter morning
And lo my priceless Hay
Was not upon the Scaffold
Was not upon the Beam
And from a thriving Farmer
A Cynic I became
Whether a Thief did it
Whether it was the wind
Whether Deitys guiltless
My business is to find
So I begin to ransack
How is it Hearts with Thee
Art thou within the little Barn
Love provided Thee
I could bring You Jewelshad I a mind to
But You have enoughof those
I could bring You Odors from St Domingo
Colorsfrom Vera Cruz
Berries of the Bahamashave I
But this little Blaze
Flickering to itselfin the Meadow
Suits Memore than those
Never a Fellow matched this Topaz
And his Emerald Swing
Dower itselffor Bobadilo
BetterCould I bring
I could dieto know
Tis a trifling knowledge
NewsBoys salute the Door
Cartsjoggle by
Mornings bold facestares in the window
Were but minethe Charter of the least Fly
Houses hunch the House
With their Brick Shoulders
Coalsfrom a Rolling Loadrattlehownear
To the very SquareHis foot is passing
Possibly this moment
While IdreamHere
I could not drink it Sweet
Till You had tasted first
Though cooler than the Water was
The Thoughtfullness of Thirst
I could not prove the Years had feet
Yet confident they run
Am I from symptoms that are past
And Series that are done
I find my feet have further Goals
I smile upon the Aims
That felt so ampleYesterday
Todayshave vaster claims
I do not doubt the self I was
Was competent to me
But something awkward in the fit
Proves thatoutgrownI see
I could suffice for Him I knew
Hecould suffice for Me
Yet Hesitating FractionsBoth
Surveyed Infinity
Would I be Whole He sudden broached
My syllable rebelled
Twas face to face with Natureforced
Twas face to face with God
Withdrew the Sunto Other Wests
Withdrew the furthest Star
Before Decisionstooped to speech
And thenbe audibler
The Answer of the Sea unto
The Motion of the Moon
Herself adjust Her Tidesunto
Could Ido elsewith Mine
I cried at Pitynot at Pain
I heard a Woman say
Poor Childand something in her voice
Convicted meof me
So long I fainted to myself
It seemed the common way
And Health and Laughter Curious things
To look at like a Toy
To sometimes hear Rich people buy
And see the Parcel rolled
And carried I supposedto Heaven
For children made of Gold
But not to touch or wish for
Or think of with a sigh
And so and sohad been to me
Had God willed differently
I wish I knew that Womans name
So when she comes this way
To hold my life and hold my ears
For fear I hear her say
Shes sorry I am deadagain
Just when the Grave and I
Have sobbed ourselves almost to sleep
Our only Lullaby
I cross till I am weary
A Mountainin my mind
More Mountainsthen a Sea
More SeasAnd then
A Desertfind
And My Horizon blocks
With steadydriftingGrains
Of unconjectured quantity
As Asiatic Rains
Nor thisdefeat my Pace
It hinder from the West
But as an Enemys Salute
One hurrying to Rest
What merit had the Goal
Except there intervene
Faint Doubtand far Competitor
To jeopardize the Gain
At lastthe Grace in sight
I shout unto my feet
I offer them the Whole of Heaven
The instant that we meet
They striveand yet delay
They perishDo we die
Or is this Deaths Experiment
Reversedin Victory
I died for beauty but was scarce
Adjusted in the tomb
When one who died for truth was lain
In an adjoining room
He questioned softly why I failed
For beauty I replied
And I for truththe two are one
We brethren are he said
And so as kinsmen met a night
We talked between the rooms
Until the moss had reached our lips
And covered up our names
I died for beauty but was scarce
Adjusted in the tomb
When one who died for truth was lain
In an adjoining room
He questioned softly why I failed
For beauty I replied
And I for truth the two are one
We brethren are he said
And so as kinsmen met anight
We talked between the rooms
Until the moss had reached our lips
And covered up our names
I dreaded that first Robin so
But He is mastered now
Im accustomed to Him grown
He hurts a little though
I thought If I could only live
Till that first Shout got by
Not all Pianos in the Woods
Had power to mangle me
I dared not meet the Daffodils
For fear their Yellow Gown
Would pierce me with a fashion
So foreign to my own
I wished the Grass would hurry
Sowhen twas time to see
Hed be too tall the tallest one
Could stretchto look at me
I could not bear the Bees should come
I wished theyd stay away
In those dim countries where they go
What word had they for me
Theyre here though not a creature failed
No Blossom stayed away
In gentle deference to me
The Queen of Calvary
Each one salutes me as he goes
And I my childish Plumes
Lift in bereaved acknowledgment
Of their unthinking Drums
I dwell in Possibility
A fairer House than Prose
More numerous of Windows
Superiorfor Doors
Of Chambers as the Cedars
Impregnable of Eye
And for an Everlasting Roof
The Gambrels of the Sky
Of Visitorsthe fairest
For OccupationThis
The spreading wide of narrow Hands
To gather Paradise
I envy Seas whereon He rides
I envy Spokes of Wheels
Of Chariots that Him convey
I envy Crooked Hills
That gaze upon His journey
How easy All can see
What is forbidden utterly
As Heavenunto me
I envy Nests of Sparrows
That dot His distant Eaves
The wealthy Fly upon His Pane
The happyhappy Leaves
That just abroad His Window
Have Summers leave to play
The Ear Rings of Pizarro
Could not obtain for me
I envy Lightthat wakes Him
And Bellsthat boldly ring
To tell Him it is Noon abroad
Myselfbe Noon to Him
Yet interdictmy Blossom
And abrogatemy Bee
Lest Noon in Everlasting Night
Drop Gabrieland Me
I fear a Man of frugal Speech
I fear a Silent Man
HaranguerI can overtake
Or Babblerentertain
But He who weighethWhile the Rest
Expend their furthest pound
Of this ManI am wary
I fear that He is Grand
I felt a cleaving in my mind
As if my brain had split
I tried to match it seam by seam
But could not make them fit
The thought behind I strove to join
Unto the thought before
But sequence ravelled out of reach
Like balls upon a floor
I felt a Funeral in my Brain
And Mourners to and fro
Kept treadingtreadingtill it seemed
That Sense was breaking through
And when they all were seated
A Service like a Drum
Kept beatingbeatingtill I thought
My Mind was going numb
And then I heard them lift a Box
And creak across my Soul
With those same Boots of Lead again
Then Spacebegan to toll
As all the Heavens were a Bell
And Being but an Ear
And I and Silence some strange Race
Wrecked solitary here
And then a Plank in Reason broke
And I dropped down and down
And hit a World at every plunge
And Finished knowingthen
I felt my life with both my hands
To see if it was there
I held my spirit to the Glass
To prove it possibler
I turned my Being round and round
And paused at every pound
To ask the Owners name
For doubt that I should know the Sound
I judged my featuresjarred my hair
I pushed my dimples by and waited
If theytwinkled back
Conviction might of me
I told myself Take Courage Friend
Thatwas a former time
But we might learn to like the Heaven
As well as our Old Home
I found the phrase to every thought
I ever had but one
And that defies meas a hand
Did try to chalk the sun
To races nurtured in the dark
How would your own begin
Can blaze be done in cochineal
Or noon in mazarin
I gained it so
By Climbing slow
By Catching at the Twigs that grow
Between the Blissand me
It hung so high
As well the Sky
Attempt by Strategy
I said I gained it
Thiswas all
Look how I clutch it
Lest it fall
And I a Pauper go
Unfitted by an instants Grace
For the ContentedBeggars face
I worean hour ago
I gave myself to Him
And took Himself for Pay
The solemn contract of a Life
Was ratified this way
The Wealth might disappoint
Myself a poorer prove
Than this great Purchaser suspect
The Daily Ownof Love
Depreciate the Vision
But till the Merchant buy
Still Fablein the Isles of Spice
The subtle Cargoeslie
At leasttis MutualRisk
Somefound itMutual Gain
Sweet Debt of LifeEach Night to owe
Insolventevery Noon
I got so I could take his name
WithoutTremendous gain
That Stopsensationon my Soul
And Thunderin the Room
I got so I could walk across
That Angle in the floor
Where he turned so and I turnedhow
And all our Sinew tore
I got so I could stir the Box
In which his letters grew
Without that forcing in my breath
As Staplesdriven through
Could dimly recollect a Grace
I think they call it God
Renowned to ease Extremity
When Formula had failed
And shape my Hands
Petitions way
Tho ignorant of a word
That Ordinationutters
My Business with the Cloud
If any Power behind it be
Not subject to Despair
It care in some remoter way
For so minute affair
As Misery
Itself too vast for interruptingmore
I had a guinea golden
I lost it in the sand
And tho the sum was simple
And pounds were in the land
Still had it such a value
Unto my frugal eye
That when I could not find it
I sat me down to sigh
I had a crimson Robin
Who sang full many a day
But when the woods were painted
He too did fly away
Time brought me other Robins
Their ballads were the same
Still for my missing Troubador
I kept the house at hame
I had a star in heaven
One Pleiad was its name
And when I was not heeding
It wandered from the same
And tho the skies are crowded
And all the night ashine
I do not care about it
Since none of them are mine
My story has a moral
I have a missing friend
Pleiad its name and Robin
And guinea in the sand
And when this mournful ditty
Accompanied with tear
Shall meet the eye of traitor
In country far from here
Grant that repentance solemn
May seize upon his mind
And he no consolation
Beneath the sun may find
I had been hungry all the years
My noon had come to dine
I trembling drew the table near
And touched the curious wine
T was this on tables I had seen
When turning hungry lone
I looked in windows for the wealth
I could not hope to own
I did not know the ample bread
T was so unlike the crumb
The birds and I had often shared
In Natures diningroom
The plenty hurt me t was so new
Myself felt ill and odd
As berry of a mountain bush
Transplanted to the road
Nor was I hungry so I found
That hunger was a way
Of persons outside windows
The entering takes away
I had no Cause to be awake
My Bestwas gone to sleep
And Morn a new politeness took
And failed to wake them up
But called the othersclear
And passed their Curtains by
Sweet Morningwhen I oversleep
KnockRecollectto Me
I looked at SunriseOnce
And then I looked at Them
And wishfulness in me arose
For Circumstance the same
Twas such an Ample Peace
It could not hold a Sigh
Twas Sabbathwith the Bells divorced
Twas Sunsetall the Day
So choosing but a Gown
And taking but a Prayer
The only Raiment I should need
I struggledand was There
I had no time to hate because
The grave would hinder me
And life was not so ample I
Could finish enmity
Nor had I time to love but since
Some industry must be
The little toil of love I thought
Was large enough for me
I had not mindedWalls
Were Universeone Rock
And fr I heard his silver Call
The other side the Block
Id tunneltill my Groove
Pushed sudden thro to his
Then my face take her Recompense
The looking in his Eyes
But tis a single Hair
A filamenta law
A Cobwebwove in Adamant
A Battlementof Straw
A limit like the Veil
Unto the Ladys face
But every Mesha Citadel
And Dragonsin the Crease
I had some things that I called mine
And God that he called his
Till recently a rival Claim
Disturbed these amities
The property my garden
Which having sown with care
He claims the pretty acre
And sends a Bailiff there
The station of the parties
Forbids publicity
But Justice is sublimer
Than arms or pedigree
Ill institute an Action
Ill vindicate the law
Jove Choose your counsel
I retain Shaw
I had the Glorythat will do
An Honor Thought can turn her to
When lesser Fames invite
With one long Nay
Bliss early shape
DeformingDwindlingGulfing up
Times possibility
I have a Bird in spring
Which for myself doth sing
The spring decoys
And as the summer nears
And as the Rose appears
Robin is gone
Yet do I not repine
Knowing that Bird of mine
Though flown
Learneth beyond the sea
Melody new for me
And will return
Fast is a safer hand
Held in a truer Land
Are mine
And though they now depart
Tell I my doubting heart
Theyre thine
In a serener Bright
In a more golden light
I see
Each little doubt and fear
Each little discord here
Removed
Then will I not repine
Knowing that Bird of mine
Though flown
Shall in a distant tree
Bright melody for me
Return
I have a King who does not speak
Sowonderingthro the hours meek
I trudge the day away
Half glad when it is night and sleep
If haply thro a dream to peep
In parlors shut by day
And if I dowhen morning comes
It is as if a hundred drums
Did round my pillow roll
And shouts fill all my Childish sky
And Bells keep saying Victory
From steeples in my soul
And if I dontthe little Bird
Within the Orchard is not heard
And I omit to pray
Father thy will be done today
For my will goes the other way
And it were perjury
I have never seen Volcanoes
But when Travellers tell
How those oldphlegmatic mountains
Usually so still
Bear withinappalling Ordnance
Fire and smoke and gun
Taking Villages for breakfast
And appalling Men
If the stillness is Volcanic
In the human face
When upon a pain Titanic
Features keep their place
If at length the smouldering anguish
Will not overcome
And the palpitating Vineyard
In the dust be thrown
If some loving Antiquary
On Resumption Morn
Will not cry with joy Pompeii
To the Hills return
I have no life but this
To lead it here
Nor any death but lest
Dispelled from there
Nor tie to earths to come
Nor action new
Except through this extent
The Realm of You
I havent told my garden yet
Lest that should conquer me
I havent quite the strength now
To break it to the Bee
I will not name it in the street
For shops would stare at me
That one so shyso ignorant
Should have the face to die
The hillsides must not know it
Where I have rambled so
Nor tell the loving forests
The day that I shall go
Nor lisp it at the table
Nor heedless by the way
Hint that within the Riddle
One will walk today
I heard a fly buzz when I died
The stillness round my form
Was like the stillness in the air
Between the heaves of storm
The eyes beside had wrung them dry
And breaths were gathering sure
For that last onset when the king
Be witnessed in his power
I willed my keepsakes signed away
What portion of me I
Could make assignableand then
There interposed a fly
With blue uncertain stumbling buzz
Between the light and me
And then the windows failed and then
I could not see to see
I held a Jewel in my fingers
And went to sleep
The day was warm and winds were prosy
I said Twill keep
I wokeand chid my honest fingers
The Gem was gone
And now an Amethyst remembrance
Is all I own
I hide myself within my flower
That fading from your Vase
You unsuspecting feel for me
Almost a loneliness
I keep my pledge
I was not called
Death did not notice me
I bring my Rose
I plight again
By every sainted Bee
By Daisy called from hillside
by Bobolink from lane
Blossom and I
Her oath and mine
Will surely come again
I know a place where summer strives
With such a practised frost
She each year leads her daisies back
Recording briefly Lost
But when the south wind stirs the pools
And struggles in the lanes
Her heart misgives her for her vow
And she pours soft refrains
Into the lap of adamant
And spices and the dew
That stiffens quietly to quartz
Upon her amber shoe
I know lives I could miss
Without a Misery
Otherswhose instants wanting
Would be Eternity
The lasta scanty Number
Twould scarcely fill a Two
The firsta Gnats Horizon
Could easily outgrow
I know some lonely Houses off the Road
A Robberd like the look of
Wooden barred
And Windows hanging low
Inviting to
A Portico
Where two could creep
Onehand the Tools
The other peep
To make sure Alls Asleep
Old fashioned eyes
Not easy to surprise
How orderly the Kitchend look by night
With just a Clock
But they could gag the Tick
And Mice wont bark
And so the Wallsdont tell
Nonewill
A pair of Spectacles ajar just stir
An Almanacs aware
Was it the Matwinked
Or a Nervous Star
The Moonslides down the stair
To see whos there
Theres plunderwhere
Tankard or Spoon
Earringor Stone
A WatchSome Ancient Brooch
To match the Grandmama
Staid sleepingthere
Dayratt lestoo
Stealthsslow
T he Sun has got as far
As the third Sycamore
Screams Chanticleer
Whos there
And EchoesTrains away
SneerWhere
While the old Couple just astir
Fancy the Sunriseleft the door ajar
I know that He exists
Somewherein Silence
He has hid his rare life
From our gross eyes
Tis an instants play
Tis a fond Ambush
Just to make Bliss
Earn her own surprise
Butshould the play
Prove piercing earnest
Should the gleeglaze
In Deathsstiffstare
Wou ld not the fun
Look too expensive
Would not the jest
Have crawled too far
I know where Wells growDroughtless Wells
Deep dugfor Summer days
Where Mosses go no more away
And Pebblesafely plays

A Belt of jagged Stone
Inlaid with Emeraldhalf way down
And Diamondsjumbled on

A Bucket I would buy
Im often thirstybut my lips

I read in an Old fashioned Book
That People thirst no more
The Wells have Buckets to them there
It must mean thatIm sure
Shall We remember Parchingthen
Those Waters sound so grand
I think a little Welllike Mine
Dearer to understand
I learnedat leastwhat Home could be
How ignorant I had been
Of pretty ways of Covenant
How awkward at the Hymn
Round our new Firesidebut for this
This patternof the Way
Whose Memory drowns me like the Dip
Of a Celestial Sea
What Mornings in our Gardenguessed
What Beesfor usto hum
With only Birds to interrupt
The Ripple of our Theme
And Task for Both

And then Returnand Nightand Home
And then away to You to pass

Till Sunrise take us back to Scene
TransmutedVivider
This seems a Home
And Home is not
But what that Place could be
Afflicts meas a Setting Sun
Where Dawnknows how to be
I like a look of Agony
Because I know its true
Men do not sham Convulsion
Nor simulate a Throe
The Eyes glaze onceand that is Death
Impossible to feign
The Beads upon the Forehead
By homely Anguish strung
I like to see it lap the miles
And lick the valleys up
And stop to feed itself at tanks
And then prodigious step
Around a pile of mountains
And supercilious peer
In shanties by the sides of roads
And then a quarry pare
To fit its sides and crawl between
Complaining all the while
In horrid hooting stanza
Then chase itself down hill
And neigh like Boanerges
Then punctual as a star
Stopdocile and omnipotent
At its own stable door
I live with HimI see His face
I go no more away
For Visitoror Sundown
Deaths single privacy
The Only Oneforestalling Mine
And thatby Right that He
Presents a Claim invisible

To witness to the Certainty
Of Immortality

The stimulus there is
In danger other impetus
Is numb and vitalless

A fear will urge it where
To go without the spectres aid

That every sighmay lift you
Just as highas I
Andwhen I die

Still to showhow rich I go
Lest Skies impeach a wealth so wonderful
And banish me
Ill send the feather from my Hat
Who knowsbut at the sight of that
My Sovereign will relent
As trinketworn by faded Child
Confronting eyes longcomforted
Blisters the Adamant
I’ll tell you how the sun rose
A ribbon at a time
The steeples swam in amethyst
The news like squirrels ran
The hills untied their bonnets
The bobolinks begun
Then I said softly to myself
That must have been the sun
But how he set I know not
There seemed a purple stile
Which little yellow boys and girls
Were climbing all the while
Till when they reached the other side
A dominie in gray
Put gently up the evening bars
And led the flock away
I lost a World the other day
Has Anybody found
Youll know it by the Row of Stars
Around its forehead bound
A Rich manmight not notice it
Yetto my frugal Eye
Of more Esteem than Ducats
Oh find itSirfor me
Im cededIve stopped being Theirs
The name They dropped upon my face
With water in the country church
Is finished using now
And They can put it with my Dolls
My childhood and the string of spools
Ive finished threadingtoo
Baptized before without the choice
But this time consciously of Grace
Unto supremest name
Called to my FullThe Crescent dropped
Existences whole Arc filled up
With one small Diadem
My second Ranktoo small the first
CrownedCrowingon my Fathers breast
A half unconscious Queen
But this timeAdequateErect
With Will to choose or to reject
And I choose just a Crown
Im nobody Who are you
Are you nobody too
Then theres a pair of us dont tell
Theyd banish you know
How dreary to be somebody
How public like a frog
To tell ones name the livelong day
To an admiring bog
Im saying every day
If I should be a Queen tomorrow
Id do this way
And so I deck a little
If it be I wake a Bourbon
None on me bend supercilious
With This was she
Begged in the Market place
Yesterday
Court is a stately place
Ive heard men say
So I loop my apron against the Majesty
With bright Pins of Buttercup
That not too plain
Rankovertake me
And perch my Tongue
On Twigs of singingrather high
But this might be my brief Term
To qualify
Put from my simple speech all plain word
Take other accents as such I heard
Though but for the Cricketjust
And but for the Bee
Not in all the Meadow
One accost me
Better to be ready
Than did next morn
Meet me in Aragon
My old Gownon
And the surprised Air
Rusticswear
Summonedmdas hunexpectedly
To Exeter
Im sorry for the DeadToday
Its such congenial times
Old Neighbors have at fences
Its time o year for Hay
And BroadSunburned Acquaintance
Discourse between the Toil
And laugh a homely species
That makes the Fences smile
It seems so straight to lie away
From all of the noise of Fields
The Busy Cartsthe fragrant Cocks
The Mowers MetreSteals
A Trouble lest theyre homesick
Those Farmersand their Wives
Set separate from the Farming
And all the Neighbors lives
A Wonder if the Sepulchre
Dont feel a lonesome way
When Menand Boysand Cartsand June
Go down the Fields to Hay
Im the little Hearts Ease
I dont care for pouting skies
If the Butterfly delay
Can I therefore stay away
If the Coward Bumble Bee
In his chimney corner stay
I must resoluter be
Wholl apologize for me
Dear Old fashioned little flower
Eden is old fashioned too
Birds are antiquated fellows
Heaven does not change her blue
Nor will I the little Hearts Ease
Ever be induced to do
Im the little Hearts Ease
I dont care for pouting skies
If the Butterfly delay
Can I therefore stay away
If the Coward Bumble Bee
In his chimney corner stay
I must resoluter be
Wholl apologize for me
Dear Old fashioned little flower
Eden is old fashioned too
Birds are antiquated fellows
Heaven does not change her blue
Nor will I the little Hearts Ease
Ever be induced to do
Im wifeIve finished that
That other state
Im CzarIm Woman now
Its safer so
How odd the Girls life looks
Behind this soft Eclipse
I think that Earth feels so
To folks in Heavennow
This being comfortthen
That other kindwas pain
But why compare
Im Wife Stop there
Im wifeIve finished that
That other state

I made slow Riches but my Gain
Was steady as the Sun
And every Night it numbered more
Than the preceding One
All Days I did not earn the same
But my perceiveless Gain
Inferred the less by Growing than
The Sum that it had grown
I make His Crescent fill or lack
His Nature is at Full
Or Quarteras I signify
His Tidesdo I control
He holds superior in the Sky
Or gropes at my Command
Behind inferior Cloudsor round
A Mists slow Colonnade
But since We hold a Mutual Disc
And front a Mutual Day
Which is the Despot neither knows
Nor Whosethe Tyranny
I many times thought Peace had come
When Peace was far away
As Wrecked Mendeem they sight the Land
At Centre of the Sea
And struggle slackerbut to prove
As hopelessly as I
How many the fictitious Shores
Before the Harbor be
I meant to find Her when I came
Deathhad the same design
But the Successwas Hisit seems
And the SurrenderMine
I meant to tell Her how I longed
For just this single time
But Death had told Her so the first
And she had past with Him
To wandernowis my Repose
To restTo rest would be
A privilege of Hurricane
To Memoryand Me
I meant to have but modest needs
Such as Contentand Heaven
Within my incomethese could lie
And Life and Ikeep even
But since the lastincluded both
It would suffice my Prayer
But just for Oneto stipulate
And Grace would grant the Pair
And soupon this wiseI prayed
Great SpiritGive to me
A Heaven not so large as Yours
But large enoughfor me
A Smile suffused Jehovahs face
The Cherubimwithdrew
Grave Saints stole out to look at me
And showed their dimplestoo
I left the Place with all my might
I threw my Prayer away
The Quiet Ages picked it up
And Judgmenttwinkledtoo
Tat one so honestbe extant
It take the Tale for true
That Whatsoever Ye shall ask
Itself be given You
But I grown shrewderscan the Skies
With a suspicious Air
As Childrenswindled for the first
All Swindlersbeinfer
I measure every Grief I meet
With narrow probing Eyes
I wonder if It weighs like Mine
Or has an Easier size
I wonder if They bore it long
Or did it just begin
I could not tell the Date of Mine
It feels so old a pain
I wonder if it hurts to live
And if They have to try
And whethercould They choose between
It would not beto die
I note that Somegone patient long
At length renew their smile
An imitation of a Light
That has so little Oil
I wonder if when Years have piled
Some Thousandson the Harm
That hurt them earlysuch a lapse
Could give them any Balm
Or would they go on aching still
Through Centuries of Nerve
Enlightened to a larger Pain
In Contrast with the Love
The Grievedare manyI am told
There is the various Cause
Deathis but oneand comes but once
And only nails the eyes
Theres Grief of Wantand grief of Cold
A sort they call Despair
Theres Banishment from native Eyes
In Sight of Native Air
And though I may not guess the kind
Correctlyyet to me
A piercing Comfort it affords
In passing Calvary
To note the fashionsof the Cross
And how theyre mostly worn
Still fascinated to presume
That Someare like My Own
I meant to find her when I came
Death had the same design
But the success was his it seems
And the discomfit mine
I meant to tell her how I longed
For just this single time
But Death had told her so the first
And she had hearkened him
To wander now is my abode
To restto rest would be
A privilege of hurricane
To memory and me
I met a King this afternoon
He had not on a Crown indeed
A little Palmleaf Hat was all
And he was barefoot Im afraid
But sure I am he Ermine wore
Beneath his faded Jackets blue
And sure I am the crest he bore
Within that Jackets pocket too
For twas too stately for an Earl
A Marquis would not go so grand
Twas possibly a Czar petite
A Pope or something of that kind
If I must tell you of a Horse
My freckled Monarch held the rein
Doubtless an estimable Beast
But not at all disposed to run
And such a wagon While I live
Dare I presume to see
Another such a vehicle
As then transported me
Two other ragged Princes
His royal state partook
Doubtless the first excursion
These sovereigns ever took
I question if the Royal Coach
Round which the Footmen wait
Has the significance on high
Of this Barefoot Estate
I never felt at HomeBelow
And in the Handsome Skies
I shall not feel at HomeI know
I dont like Paradise
Because its Sundayall the time
And Recessnever comes
And Edenll be so lonesome
Bright Wednesday Afternoons
If God could make a visit
Or ever took a Nap
So not to see usbut they say
Himselfa Telescope
Perennial beholds us
Myself would run away
From Himand Holy Ghostand All
But theres the Judgement Day
I never hear the word escape
Without a quicker blood
A sudden expectation
A flying attitude
I never hear of prisons broad
By soldiers battered down
But I tug childish at my bars
Only to fail again
I never lost as much but twice
And that was in the sod
Twice have I stood a beggar
Before the door of God
Angelstwice descending
Reimbursed my store
Burglar BankerFather
I am poor once more
I never saw a moor
I never saw the sea
Yet know I how the heather looks
And what a billow be
I never spoke with God
Nor visited in heaven
Yet certain am I of the spot
As if the checks were given
I never told the buried gold
Upon the hillthat lies
I saw the sunhis plunder done
Crouch low to guard his prize
He stood as near
As stood you here
A pace had been between
Did but a snake bisect the brake
My life had forfeit been
That was a wondrous booty
I hope twas honest gained
Those were the fairest ingots
That ever kissed the spade
Whether to keep the secret
Whether to reveal
Whether as I ponder
Kidd will sudden sail
Could a shrewd advise me
We might een divide
Should a shrewd betray me
Atropos decide
I noticed People disappeared
When but a little child
Supposed they visited remote
Or settled Regions wild
But did because they died
A Fact withheld the little child
I often passed the village
When going home from school
And wondered what they did there
And why it was so still
I did not know the year then
In which my call would come
Earlier by the Dial
Than the rest have gone
Its stiller than the sundown
Its cooler than the dawn
The Daisies dare to come here
And birds can flutter down
So when you are tired
Or perplexedor cold
Trust the loving promise
Underneath the mould
Cry its I take Dollie
And I will enfold
I payin Satin Cash
You did not stateyour price
A Petal for a Paragraph
It near as I can guess
I play at Richesto appease
The Clamoring for Gold
It kept me from a Thief I think
For often overbold
With Want and Opportunity
I could have done a Sin
And been Myself that easy Thing
An independent Man
But often as my lot displays
Too hungry to be borne
I deem Myself what I would be
And novel Comforting
My Poverty and I derive
We question if the Man
Who ownEsteem the Opulence
As WeWho never Can
Should ever these exploring Hands
Chance Sovereign on a Mine
Or in the longuneven term
To win become their turn
How fitter they will befor Want
Enlightening so well
I know not which Desire or Grant
Be wholly beautiful
I prayed at first a little Girl
Because they told me to
But stopped when qualified to guess
How prayer would feelto me
If I believed God looked around
Each time my Childish eye
Fixed full and steady on his own
In Childish honesty
And told him what Id like today
And parts of his far plan
That baffled me
The mingled side
Of his Divinity
And often since in Danger
I count the force twould be
To have a God so strong as that
To hold my life for me
Till I could take the Balance
That tips so frequent now
It takes me all the while to poise
And thenit doesnt stay
I read my sentencesteadily
Reviewed it with my eyes
To see that I made no mistake
In its extremest clause
The Date and manner of the shame
And then the Pious Form
That God have mercy on the Soul
The Jury voted Him
I made my soul familiarwith her extremity
That at the last it should not be a novel Agony
But she and Death acquainted
Meet tranquilly as friends
Salute and pass without a Hint
And there the Matter ends
I reason Earth is short
And Anguishabsolute
And many hurt
But what of that
I reason we could die
The best Vitality
Cannot excel Decay
But what of that
I reason that in Heaven
Somehow it will be even
Some new Equation given
But what of that
I reckonwhen I count it all
FirstPoetsThen the Sun
Then SummerThen the Heaven of God
And thenthe List is done
But looking backthe First so seems
To Comprehend the Whole
The Others look a needless Show
So I writePoetsAll
Their Summerlasts a Solid Year
They can afford a Sun
The Eastwould deem extravagant
And if the Further Heaven
Be Beautiful as they prepare
For Those who worship Them
It is too difficult a Grace
To justify the Dream
I robbed the Woods
The trusting Woods
The unsuspecting Trees
Brought out their Burs and mosses
My fantasy to please
I scanned their trinkets curiousI graspedI bore away
What will the solemn Hemlock
What will the Oak tree say
I rosebecause He sank
I thought it would be opposite
But when his power dropped
My Soul grew straight
I cheered my fainting Prince
I sang firmevenChants
I helped his Filmwith Hymn
And when the Dews drew off
That held his Forehead stiff
I met him
Balm to Balm
I told him Bestmust pass
Through this low Arch of Flesh
No Casque so brave
It spurn the Grave
I told him Worlds I knew
Where Emperors grew
Who recollected us
If we were true
And so with Thews of Hymn
And Sinew from within
And ways I knew not that I knewtill then
I lifted Him
I saw no WayThe Heavens were stitched
I felt the Columns close
The Earth reversed her Hemispheres
I touched the Universe
And back it slidand I alone
A Speck upon a Ball
Went out upon Circumference
Beyond the Dip of Bell
I saw the wind within her
I knew it blew for me
But she must buy my shelter
I asked Humility
I see thee betterin the Dark
I do not need a Light
The Love of Theea Prism be
Excelling Violet
I see thee better for the Years
That hunch themselves between
The Miners Lampsufficient be
To nullify the Mine
And in the GraveI see Thee best
Its little Panels be
AglowAll ruddywith the Light
I held so high for Thee
What need of Day
To Those whose Darkhath sosurpassing Sun
It deem it beContinually
At the Meridian
I send Two Sunsets
Day and Iin competition ran
I finished Twoand several Stars
While Hewas making One
His own was amplerbut as I
Was saying to a friend
Mineis the more convenient
To Carry in the Hand
I shall keep singing
Birds will pass me
On their way to Yellower Climes
Eachwith a Robins expectation
Iwith my Redbreast
And my Rhymes
Latewhen I take my place in summer
ButI shall bring a fuller tune
Vespersare sweeter than MatinsSignor
Morningonly the seed of Noon
I shall know whywhen Time is over
And I have ceased to wonder why
Christ will explain each separate anguish
In the fair schoolroom of the sky
He will tell me what Peter promised
And Ifor wonder at his woe
I shall forget the drop of Anguish
That scalds me nowthat scalds me now
I should have been too glad I see
Too liftedfor the scant degree
Of Lifes penurious Round
My little Circuit would have shamed
This new Circumferencehave blamed
The homelier time behind
I should have been too savedI see
Too rescuedFear too dim to me
That I could spell the Prayer
I knew so perfectyesterday
That Scalding OneSabachthani
Recited fluenthere
Earth would have been too muchI see
And Heavennot enough for me
I should have had the Joy
Without the Fearto justify
The Palmwithout the Calvary
So SaviorCrucify
Defeatwhets Victorythey say
The Reefsin old Gethsemane
Endear the Coastbeyond
Tis BeggarsBanquetscan define
Tis Parchingvitalizes Wine
Faith bleatsto understand
I should not dare to leave my friend
Becausebecause if he should die
While I was goneand Itoo late
Should reach the Heart that wanted me
If I should disappoint the eyes
That huntedhunted soto see
And could not bear to shut until
They noticed methey noticed me
If I should stab the patient faith
So sure Id comeso sure Id come
It listeninglisteningwent to sleep
Telling my tardy name
My Heart would wish it broke before
Since breaking thensince breaking then
Were useless as next mornings sun
Where midnight frostshad lain
I showed her Heights she never saw
Wouldst Climb I said
She saidNot so
With me I saidWith me
I showed her SecretsMornings Nest
The Rope the Nights were put across
And nowWouldst have me for a Guest
She could not find her Yes
And then I brake my lifeAnd Lo
A Light for her did solemn glow
The larger as her face withdrew
And could she further No
I sing to use the Waiting
My Bonnet but to tie
And shut the Door unto my House
No more to do have I
Till His best step approaching
We journey to the Day
And tell each other how We sung
To Keep the Dark away
I sometimes drop it for a Quick
The Thought to be alive
Anonymous Delight to know
And Madderto conceive
Consoles a Woe so monstrous
That did it tear all Day
Without an instants Respite
Twould look too farto Die
I started Early Took my Dog
And visited the Sea
The Mermaids in the Basement
Came out to look at me
And Frigates in the Upper Floor
Extended Hempen Hands
Presuming Me to be a Mouse
Aground upon the Sands
But no Man moved Me till the Tide
Went past my simple Shoe
And past my Apron and my Belt
And past my Bodice too
And made as He would eat me up
As wholly as a Dew
Upon a Dandelions Sleeve
And then I started too
And He He followed close behind
I felt His Silver Heel
Upon my Ankle Then my Shoes
Would overflow with Pearl
Until We met the Solid Town
No One He seemed to know
And bowing with a Mighty look
At me The Sea withdrew
I stepped from plank to plank
So slow and cautiously
The stars about my head I felt
About my feet the sea
I knew not but the next
Would be my final inch
This gave me that precarious gait
Some call experience
I stole them from a Bee
BecauseThee
Sweet plea
He pardoned me
I taste a liquor never brewed
From tankards scooped in pearl
Not all the vats upon the Rhine
Yield such an alcohol
Inebriate of air am I
And debauchee of dew
Reeling through endless summer days
From inns of molten blue
When the landlord turn the drunken bee
Out of the foxgloves door
When butterflies renounce their drams
I shall but drink the more
Till seraphs swing their snowy hats
And saints to windows run
To see the little tippler
Leaning against the sun
I tend my flowers for thee
Bright Absentee
My Fuchsias Coral Seams
Ripwhile the Sowerdreams
Geraniums tintand spot
Low Daisiesdot
My Cactussplits her Beard
To show her throat
Carnationstip their spice
And Beespick up
A HyacinthI hid
Puts out a Ruffled Head
And odors fall
From flasksso small
You marvel how they held
Globe Rosesbreak their satin glake
Upon my Garden floor
Yetthounot there
I had as lief they bore
No Crimsonmore
Thy flowerbe gay
Her Lordaway
It ill becometh me
Ill dwell in CalyxGray
How modestlyalway
Thy Daisy
Draped for thee
I think I was enchanted
When first a sombre Girl
I read that Foreign Lady
The Darkfelt beautiful
And whether it was noon at night
Or only Heavenat Noon
For very Lunacy of Light
I had not power to tell
The Beesbecame as Butterflies
The Butterfliesas Swans
Approachedand spurned the narrow Grass
And just the meanest Tunes
That Nature murmured to herself
To keep herself in Cheer
I took for Giantspractising
Titanic Opera
The Daysto Mighty Metres stept
The Homeliestadorned
As if unto a Jubilee
Twere suddenly confirmed
I could not have defined the change
Conversion of the Mind
Like Sanctifying in the Soul
Is witnessednot explained
Twas a Divine Insanity
The Danger to be Sane
Should I again experience
Tis Antidote to turn
To Tomes of solid Witchcraft
Magicians be asleep
But Magichath an Element
Like Deityto keep
I think just how my shape will rise
When I shall be forgiven
Till Hairand Eyesand timid Head
Are out of sightin Heaven
I think just how my lips will weigh
With shapelessquiveringprayer
That youso lateConsider me
The Sparrow of your Care
I mind me that of Anguishsent
Some drifts were moved away
Before my simple bosombroke
And why not thisif they
And so I con that thingforgiven
Until mdashdeliriousborne
By my long brightand longertrust
I drop my Heartunshriven
I think the Hemlock likes to stand
Upon a Marge of Snow
It suits his own Austerity
And satisfies an awe
That men must slake in Wilderness
And in the Desertcloy
An instinct for the Hoar the Bald
Laplandsnecessity
I think the longest Hour of all
Is when the Cars have come
And we are waiting for the Coach
It seems as though the Time
Indignantthat the Joy was come
Did block the Gilded Hands
And would not let the Seconds by
But slowest instantends
The Pendulum begins to count
Like little Scholarsloud
The steps grow thickerin the Hall
The Heart begins to crowd
Then Imy timid service done
Tho service twas of Love
Take up my little Violin
And further Northremove
I think to Livemay be a Bliss
To those who dare to try
Beyond my limit to conceive
My lipto testify
I think the Heart I former wore
Could widentill to me
The Other like the little Bank
Appearunto the Sea
I think the Dayscould every one
In Ordination stand
And Majestybe easier
Than an inferior kind
No numb alarmlest Difference come
No Goblinon the Bloom
No start in Apprehensions Ear
No Bankruptcyno Doom
But Certainties of Sun
Midsummerin the Mind
A steadfast Southupon the Soul
Her Polar timebehind
The Visionpondered long
So plausible becomes
That I esteem the fictionreal
The Realfictitious seems
How bountiful the Dream
What Plentyit would be
Had all my Life but been Mistake
Just rectifiedin Thee
I thought the Train would never come
How slow the whistle sang
I dont believe a peevish Bird
So whimpered for the Spring
I taught my Heart a hundred times
Precisely what to say
Provoking Lover when you came
Its Treatise flew away
To hide my strategy too late
To wiser be too soon
For miseries so halcyon
The happiness atone
I tie my HatI crease my Shawl
Lifes little duties doprecisely
As the very least
Were infiniteto me
I put new Blossoms in the Glass
And throw the oldaway
I push a petal from my gown
That anchored thereI weigh
The time twill be till six oclock
I have so much to do
And yetExistencesome way back
Stoppedstruckmy ticklingthrough
We cannot put Ourself away
As a completed Man
Or WomanWhen the Errands done
We came to Fleshupon
There may beMiles on Miles of Nought
Of Actionsicker far
To simulateis stinging work
To cover what we are
From Scienceand from Surgery
Too Telescopic Eyes
To bear on us unshaded
For theirsakenot for Ours
Twould start them
Wecould tremble
But since we got a Bomb
And held it in our Bosom
NayHold itit is calm
Thereforewe do lifes labor
Though lifes Rewardbe done
With scrupulous exactness
To hold our Senseson
I took my Power in my Hand
And went against the World
Twas not so much as Davidhad
But Iwas twice as bold
I aimed by Pebblebut Myself
Was all the one that fell
Was it Goliathwas too large
Or was myselftoo small
I tried to think a lonelier Thing
Than any I had seen
Some Polar ExpiationAn Omen in the Bone
Of Deaths tremendous nearness
I probed Retrieverless things
My Duplicateto borrow
A Haggard Comfort springs
From the belief that Somewhere
Within the Clutch of Thought
There dwells one other Creature
Of Heavenly Loveforgot
I plucked at our Partition
As One should pry the Walls
Between Himselfand Horrors Twin
Within Opposing Cells
I almost strove to clasp his Hand
Such Luxuryit grew
That as Myselfcould pity Him
Perhaps hepitied me
Ive heard an Organ talk sometimes
In a Cathedral Aisle
And understood no word it said
Yet held my breath the while
And risen upand gone away
A more Berdardine Girl
Yetknow not what was done to me
In that old Chapel Aisle
Ive known a Heaven like a Tent
To wrap its shining Yards
Pluck up its stakes and disappear
Without the sound of Boards
Or Rip of NailOr Carpenter
But just the miles of Stare
That signalize a Shows Retreat
In North America
No Traceno Figment of the Thing
That dazzled Yesterday
No Ringno Marvel
Men and Feats
Dissolved as utterly
As Birds far Navigation
Discloses just a Hue
A plash of Oars a Gaiety
Then swallowed up of View
Ive none to tell me to but Thee
So when Thou failest nobody
It was a little tie
It just held Two nor those it held
Since Somewhere thy sweet Face has spilled
Beyond my Boundary
If things were oppositeand Me
And Me it werethat ebbed from Thee
On some unanswering Shore
Wouldst Thou seek sojust say
That I the Answer may pursue
Unto the lips it eddied through
Soovertaking Thee
Ive nothing elseto bring You know
So I keep bringing These
Just as the Night keeps fetching Stars
To our familiar eyes
Maybe we shouldnt mind them
Unless they didnt come
Thenmaybe it would puzzle us
To find our way Home
Ive seen a Dying Eye
Run round and round a Room
In search of Somethingas it seemed
Then Cloudier become
And thenobscure with Fog
And thenbe soldered down
Without disclosing what it be
Twere blessed to have seen
I wantit pleadedAll its life
I wantwas chief it said
When Skill entreated itthe last
And when so newly dead
I could not deem it lateto hear
That singlesteadfast sigh
The lips had placed as with a Please
Toward Eternity
I wantit pleadedAll its life
I wantwas chief it said
When Skill entreated itthe last
And when so newly dead
I could not deem it lateto hear
That singlesteadfast sigh
The lips had placed as with a Please
Toward Eternity
I was the slightest in the House
I took the smallest Room
At night my little Lamp and Book
And one Geranium
So stationed I could catch the Mint
That never ceased to fall
And just my Basket
Let me thinkIm sure
That this was all
I never spokeunless addressed
And then twas brief and low
I could not bear to livealoud
The Racket shamed me so
And if it had not been so far
And any one I knew
Were goingI had often thought
How notelessI could die
I watched the Moon around the House
Until upon a Pane
She stopped a Travellers privilege for Rest
And there upon
I gazed as at a stranger
The Lady in the Town
Doth think no incivility
To lift her Glass upon
But never Stranger justified
The Curiosity
Like Mine for not a Foot nor Hand
Nor Formula had she
But like a Head a Guillotine
Slid carelessly away
Did independent Amber
Sustain her in the sky
Or like a Stemless Flower
Upheld in rolling Air
By finer Gravitations
Than bind Philosopher
No Hunger had she nor an Inn
Her Toilette to suffice
Nor Avocation nor Concern
for little Mysteries
As harass us like Life and Death
And Afterwards or Nay
But seemed engrossed to Absolute
With shining and the Sky
The privilege to scrutinize
Was scarce upon my Eyes
When with a Silver practise
She vaulted out of Gaze
And next I met her on a Cloud
Myself too far below
To follow her superior Road
Or its advantage Blue
I went to heaven
T was a small town
Lit with a ruby
Lathed with down
Stiller than the fields
At the full dew
Beautiful as pictures
No man drew
People like the moth
Of mechlin frames
Duties of gossamer
And eider names
Almost contented
I could be
Mong such unique
Society
I went to thank Her
But She Slept
Her Beda funneled Stone
With Nosegays at the Head and Foot
That Travellershad thrown
Who went to thank Her
But She Slept
Twas Shortto cross the Sea
To look upon Her likealive
But turning backtwas slow
I would distil a cup
And bear to all my friends
Drinking to her no more astir
By beck or burn or moor
I would not painta picture
Id rather be the One
Its bright impossibility
To dwelldeliciouson
And wonder how the fingers feel
Whose rarecelestialstir
Evokes so sweet a Torment
Such sumptuousDespair
I would not talk like Cornets
Id rather be the One
Raised softly to the Ceilings
And out and easy on
Through Villages of Ether
Myself endued Balloon
By but a lip of Metal
The pier to my Pontoon
Nor would I be a Poet
Its finerown the Ear
Enamoredimpotentcontent
The License to revere
A privilege so awful
What would the Dower be
Had I the Art to stun myself
With Bolts of Melody
I years had been from home
And now before the door
I dared not open lest a face
I never saw before
Stare vacant into mine
And ask my business there
My businessjust a life I left
Was such still dwelling there
I fumbled at my nerve
I scanned the windows near
The silence like an ocean rolled
And broke against my ear
I laughed a wooden laugh
That I could fear a door
Who danger and the dead had faced
But never quaked before
I fitted to the latch
My hand with trembling care
Lest back the awful door should spring
And leave me standing there
I moved my fingers off
As cautiously as glass
And held my ears and like a thief
Fled gasping from the house
Ideals are the Fairly Oil
With which we help the Wheel
But when the Vital Axle turns
The Eye rejects the Oil
If all the griefs I am to have
Would only come today
I am so happy I believe
Theyd laugh and run away
If all the joys I am to have
Would only come today
They could not be so big as this
That happens to me now
If any sink assure that this now standing
Failed like Themselvesand conscious that it rose
Grew by the Fact and not the Understanding
How Weakness passedor Forcearose
Tell that the Worst is easy in a Moment
Dread but the Whizzing before the Ball
When the Ball enters enters Silence
Dyingannuls the power to kill
If anybodys friend be dead
Its sharpest of the theme
The thinking how they walked alive
At such and such a time
Their costume of a Sunday
Some manner of the Hair
A prank nobody knew but them
Lost in the Sepulchre
How warm they were on such a day
You almost feel the date
So short way off it seems
And nowtheyre Centuries from that
How pleased they were at what you said
You try to touch the smile
And dip your fingers in the frost
When was itCan you tell
You asked the Company to tea
Acquaintancejust a few
And chatted close with this Grand Thing
That dont remember you
Past Bows and Invitations
Past Interview and Vow
Past what Ourself can estimate
Thatmakes the Quick of Woe
If Blame be my sideforfeit Me
But doom me not to forfeit Thee
To forfeit Thee The very name
Is sentence from Beliefand House
If ever the lid gets off my head
And lets the brain away
The fellow will go where he belonged
Without a hint from me
And the world if the world be looking on
Will see how far from home
It is possible for sense to live
The soul there all the time
If He dissolvethenthere is nothingmore
Eclipseat Midnight
It was darkbefore
Sunsetat Easter
Blindnesson the Dawn
Faint Star of Bethlehem
Gone down
Would but some Godinform Him
Or it be too late
Saythat the pulse just lisps
The Chariots wait
Saythat a little lifefor His
Is leakingred
His little Spanieltell Him
Will He heed
If He were livingdare I ask
And how if He be dead
And so around the Words I went
Of meeting themafraid
I hinted ChangesLapse of Time
The Surfaces of Years
I touched with Cautionlest they crack
And show me to my fears
Reverted to adjoining Lives
Adroitly turning out
Wherever I suspected Graves
Twas prudenterI thought
And HeI pushedwith sudden force
In face of the Suspense
Was buriedBuried He
My Life just holds the Trench
If I can stop one heart from breaking
I shall not live in vain
If I can ease one life the aching
Or cool one pain
Or help one fainting robin
Unto his nest again
I shall not live in vain
If I could bribe them by a Rose
Id bring them every flower that grows
From Amherst to Cashmere
I would not stop for night or storm
Or frost or death or anyone
My business were so dear
If they would linger for a Bird
My Tambourin were soonest heard
Among the April Woods
Unwearied all the summer long
Only to break in wilder song
When Winter shook the boughs
What if they hear me
Who shall say
That such an importunity
May not at last avail
That weary of this Beggars face
They may not finally say Yes
To drive her from the Hall
If Im lostnow
That I was found
Shall still my transport be
That onceon methose Jasper Gates
Blazed opensuddenly
That in my awkwardgazingface
The Angelssoftly peered
And touched me with their fleeces
Almost as if they cared
Im banishednowyou know it
How foreign that can be
Youll knowSirwhen the Saviors face
Turns soaway from you
If I may have it when its dead
Ill be contentedso
If just as soon as Breath is out
It shall belong to me
Until they lock it in the Grave
Tis Bliss I cannot weigh
For tho they lock Thee in the Grave
Myselfcan own the key
Think of it Lover I and Thee
Permittedface to face to be
After a Lifea DeathWell say
For Death was That
And thisis Thee
Ill tell Thee Allhow Bald it grew
How Midnight felt at firstto me
How all the Clocks stopped in the World
And Sunshine pinched meTwas so cold
Then how the Grief got sleepysome
As if my Soul were deaf and dumb
Just making signsacrossto Thee
That this waythou couldst notice me
Ill tell you how I tried to keep
A smile to show you when this Deep
All WadedWe look back for Play
At those Old Timesin Calvary
Forgive me if the Grave come slow
For Coveting to look at Thee
Forgive me if to stroke thy frost
Outvisions Paradise
If I should cease to bring a Rose
Upon a festal day
Twill be because beyond the Rose
I have been called away
If I should cease to take the names
My buds commemorate
Twill be because Deaths finger
Claps my murmuring lip
If I should die
And you should live
And time should gurgle on
And morn should beam
And noon should burn
As it has usual done
If Birds should build as early
And Bees as bustling go
One might depart at option
From enterprise below
Tis sweet to know that stocks will stand
When we with Daisies lie
That Commerce will continue
And Trades as briskly fly
It makes the parting tranquil
And keeps the soul serene
That gentlemen so sprightly
Conduct the pleasing scene
If I shouldnt be alive
When the Robins come
Give the one in Red Cravat
A Memorial crumb
If I couldnt thank you
Being fast asleep
You will know Im trying
Why my Granite lip
If it had no pencil
Would it try mine
Wornnowand dullsweet
Writing much to thee
If it had no word
Would it make the Daisy
Most as big as I was
When it plucked me
If Nature smiles the Mother must
Im sure at many a whim
Of Her eccentric Family
Is She so much to blame
If pain for peace prepares
Lo what Augustan years
Our feet await
If springs from winter rise
Can the Anemones
Be reckoned up
If night stands fastthen noon
To gird us for the sun
What gaze
When from a thousand skies
On our developed eyes
Noons blaze
If recollecting were forgetting
Then I remember not
And if forgetting recollecting
How near I had forgot
And if to miss were merry
And to mourn were gay
How very blithe the fingers
That gathered this Today
If she had been the Mistletoe
And I had been the Rose
How gay upon your table
My velvet life to close
Since I am of the Druid
And she is of the dew
Ill deck Traditions buttonhole
And send the Rose to you
If the foolish call them flowers
Need the wiser tell
If the Savants Classify them
It is just as well
Those who read the Revelations
Must not criticize
Those who read the same Edition
With beclouded Eyes
Could we stand with that Old Moses
Canaan denied
Scan like him the stately landscape
On the other side
Doubtless we should deem superfluous
Many Sciences
Not pursued by learned Angels
In scholastic skies
Low amid that glad Belles lettres
Grant that we may stand
Stars amid profound Galaxies
At that grand Right hand
If this is fading
Oh let me immediately fade
If this is dying
Bury me in such a shroud of red
If this is sleep
On such a night
How proud to shut the eye
Good Evening gentle Fellow men
Peacock presumes to die
If those I loved were lost
The Criers voice would tell me
If those I loved were found
The bells of Ghent would ring
Did those I loved repose
The Daisy would impel me
Philipwhen bewildered
Bore his riddle in
If What we couldwere what we would
Criterionbe small
It is the Ultimate of Talk
The Impotence to Tell
If you were coming in the fall
Id brush the summer by
With half a smile and half a spum
As housewives do a fly
If I could see you in a year
Id wind the months in balls
And put them each in separate drawers
Until their time befalls
If only centuries delayed
Id count them on my hand
Subtracting till my fingers dropped
Into Van Diemens land
If certain when this life was out
That yours and mine should be
Id toss it yonder like a rind
And taste eternity
But now all ignorant of the length
Of times uncertain wing
It goads me like the goblin bee
That will not state its sting
If your Nerve deny you
Go above your Nerve
He can lean against the Grave
If he fear to swerve
Thats a steady posture
Never any bend
Held of those Brass arms
Best Giant made
If your Soul seesaw
Lift the Flesh door
The Poltroon wants Oxygen
Nothing more
Image of Light Adieu
Thanks for the interview
So long so short
Preceptor of the whole
Coeval Cardinal
Impart Depart
Immured in Heaven
What a Cell
Let every Bondage be
Thou sweetest of the Universe
Like that which ravished thee
Impossibility like Wine
Exhilarates the Man
Who tastes it Possibility
Is flavorlessCombine
A Chances faintest Tincture
And in the former Dram
Enchantment makes ingredient
As certainly as Doom
In Ebon Box when years have flown
To reverently peer
Wiping away the velvet dust
Summers have sprinkled there
To hold a letter to the light
Grown Tawny now with time
To con the faded syllables
That quickened us like Wine
Perhaps a Flowers shrivelled check
Among its stores to find
Plucked far away some morning
By gallantmouldering hand
A curl perhaps from foreheads
Our Constancy forgot
Perhaps an Antique trinket
In vanished fashions set
And then to lay them quiet back
And go about its care
As if the little Ebon Box
Were none of our affair
In falling Timbers buried
There breathed a Man
Outsidethe spadeswere plying
The Lungswithin
Could Heknowthey sought Him
Could TheyknowHe breathed
Horrid Sand Partition
Neithercould be heard
Never slacked the Diggers
But when Spades had done
Oh Reward of Anguish
It was dyingThen
Many Thingsare fruitless
Tis a Baffling Earth
But there is no Gratitude
Like the Graceof Death
In lands I never sawthey say
Immortal Alps look down
Whose Bonnets touch the firmament
Whose Sandals touch the town
Meek at whose everlasting feet
A Myriad Daisy play
Which Sir are you and which am I
Upon an August day
In rags mysterious as these
The shining Courtiers go
Veiling the purple and the plumes
Veiling the ermine so
Smiling as they request an alms
At some imposing door
Smiling when we walk barefoot
Upon their golden floor
In snow thou comest
Thou shalt go with the resuming ground
The sweet derision of the crow
And Glees advancing sound
In fear thou comest
Thou shalt go at such a gait of joy
That man anew embark to live
Upon the depth of thee
That only lasts an hour
How much how little is
Within our power
In Winter in my Room
I came upon a Worm
Pink lank and warm
But as he was a worm
And worms presume
Not quite with him at home
Secured him by a string
To something neighboring
And went along
A Trifle afterward
A thing occurred
Id not believe it if I heard
But state with creeping blood
A snake with mottles rare
Surveyed my chamber floor
In feature as the worm before
But ringed with power
The very string with which
I tied himtoo
When he was mean and new
That string was there
I shrankHow fair you are
Propitiations claw
Afraid he hissed
Of me
No cordiality
He fathomed me
Then to a Rhythm Slim
Secreted in his Form
As Patterns swim
Projected him
That time I flew
Both eyes his way
Lest he pursue
Nor ever ceased to run
Till in a distant Town
Towns on from mine
I set me down
This was a dream
Inconceivably solemn
Things go gay
Pierceby the very Press
Of Imagery
Their far Paradesorder on the eye
With a mute Pomp
A pleading Pageantry
Flags are a brave sight
But no true Eye
Ever went by One
Steadily
Musics triumphant
But the fine Ear
Winces with delight
Are Drums too near
Is Bliss then such Abyss
I must not put my foot amiss
For fear I spoil my shoe
Id rather suit my foot
Than save my Boot
For yet to buy another Pair
Is possible
At any store
But Bliss is sold just once
The Patent lost
None buy it any more
Say Foot decide the point
The Lady cross or not
Verdict for Boot
Is it deadFind it
Out of soundOut of sight
Happy Which is wiser
You or the Wind
Conscious Wont you ask that
Of the low Ground
Homesick Many met it
Even through themThis
Cannot testify
Themselfas dumb
Is it too late to touch you Dear
We this moment knew
Love Marine and Love terrene
Love celestial too
Is it true dear Sue
Are there two
I shouldnt like to come
For fear of joggling Him
If I could shut him up
In a Coffee Cup
Or tie him to a pin
Till I got in
Or make him fast
To Tobys fist
Hist Whist Id come
It always felt to mea wrong
To that Old Mosesdone
To let him seethe Canaan
Without the entering
And tho in soberer moments
No Moses there can be
Im satisfiedthe Romance
In point of injury
Surpasses sharper stated
Of Stephenor of Paul
For thesewere only put to death
While Gods adroiter will
On Mosesseemed to fasten
With tantalizing Play
As Boyshould deal with lesser Boy
To prove ability
The faultwas doubtless Israels
Myselfhad banned the Tribes
And ushered Grand Old Moses
In Pentateuchal Robes
Upon the Broad Possession
Twas littleBut titled Himto see
Old Man on Nebo Late as this
My justice bleedsfor Thee
It bloomed and dropt a Single Noon
The Flowerdistinct and Red
I passing thought another Noon
Another in its stead
Will equal glow and thought no More
But came another Day
To find the Species disappeared
The Same Locality
The Sun in placeno other fraud
On Natures perfect Sum
Had I but lingered Yesterday
Was my retrieveless blame
Much Flowers of this and further Zones
Have perished in my Hands
For seeking its Resemblance
But unapproached it stands
The single Flower of the Earth
That I in passing by
Unconscious wasGreat Natures Face
Passed infinite by Me
It cant be Summer
Thatgot through
Its earlyyetfor Spring
Theres that long town of Whiteto cross
Before the Blackbirds sing
It cant be Dying
Its too Rouge
The Dead shall go in White
So Sunset shuts my question down
With Cuffs of Chrysolite
It ceased to hurt me though so slow
I could not feel the Anguish go
But only knew by looking back
That somethinghad benumbed the Track
Nor when it altered I could say
For I had worn it every day
As constant as the Childish frock
I hung upon the Peg at night
But not the Griefthat nestled close
As needlesladies softly press
To Cushions Cheeks
To keep their place
Nor what consoled it I could trace
Except whereas twas Wilderness
Its betteralmost Peace
It did not surprise me
So I saidor thought
She will stir her pinions
And the nest forgot
Traverse broader forests
Build in gayer boughs
Breathe in Ear more modern
Gods old fashioned vows
This was but a Birdling
What and if it be
One within my bosom
Had departed me
This was but a story
What and if indeed
There were just such coffin
In the heart instead
It dont sound so terriblequiteas it did
I run it overDead Brain Dead
Put it in Latinleft of my school
Seems it dont shriek sounder rule
Turn it a littlefull in the face
A Trouble looks bitterest
Shift itjust
Say When Tomorrow comes this way
I shall have waded down one Day
I suppose it will interrupt me some
Till I get accustomedbut then the Tomb
Like other new Thingsshows largestthen
And smaller by Habit
Its shrewder then
Put the Thought in advancea Year
How like a fitthen
Murderwear
It dropped so low in my Regard
I heard it hit the Ground
And go to pieces on the Stones
At bottom of my Mind
Yet blamed the Fate that flung it less
Than I denounced Myself
For entertaining Plated Wares
Upon My Silver Shelf
It dropped so low in my regard
I heard it hit the ground
And go to pieces on the stones
At bottom of my mind
Yet blamed the fate that fractured less
Than I reviled myself
For entertaining plated wares
Upon my silver shelf
It feels a shame to be Alive
When Men so braveare dead
One envies the Distinguished Dust
Permittedsuch a Head
The Stonethat tells defending Whom
This Spartan put away
What little of Him wepossessed
In Pawn for Liberty
The price is greatSublimely paid
Do we deservea Thing
That liveslike Dollarsmust be piled
Before we may obtain
Are we that waitsufficient worth
That such Enormous Pearl
As lifedissolved befor Us
In Battleshorrid Bowl
It may bea Renown to live
I think the Man who die
Those unsustainedSaviors
Present Divinity
It is a lonesome Glee
Yet sanctifies the Mind
With fair association
Afar upon the Wind
A Bird to overhear
Delight without a Cause
Arrestless as invisible
A matter of the Skies
It is an honorable thought
And makes one lift ones hat
As one encountered gentlefolk
Upon a daily street
That weve immortal place
Though pyramids decay
And kingdoms like the orchard
Flit russetly away
It is easy to work when the soul is at play
But when the soul is in pain
The hearing him put his playthings up
Makes work difficultthen
It is simple to ache in the Bone or the Rind
But Gimletsamong the nerve
Mangle daintierterribler
Like a Panter in the Glove
It knew no lapse nor Diminuation
But largeserene
Burned onuntil through Dissolution
It failed from Men
I could not deem these Planetary forces
Annulled
But suffered an Exchange of Territory
Or World
It knew no Medicine
It was not Sicknessthen
Nor any need of Surgery
And thereforetwas not Pain
It moved away the Cheeks
A Dimple at a time
And left the Profileplainer
And in the place of Bloom
It left the little Tint
That never had a Name
Youve seen it on a Casts face
Was Paradiseto blame
If momently ajar
Temeritydrew near
And sickenedever afterward
For Somewhat that it saw
It makes no difference abroad
The Seasonsfitthe same
The Mornings blossom into Noons
And split their Pods of Flame
Wild flowerskindle in the Woods
The Brooks slamall the Day
No Black bird bates his Banjo
For passing Calvary
Auto da Feand Judgment
Are nothing to the Bee
His separation from His Rose
To Himsums Misery
It might be lonelier
Without the Loneliness
Im so accustomed to my Fate
Perhaps the OtherPeace
Would interrupt the Dark
And crowd the little Room
Too scantby Cubitsto contain

I am not used to Hope
It might intrude upon
Its sweet paradeblaspheme the place
Ordained to Suffering
It might be easier
To failwith Land in Sight
Than gainMy Blue Peninsula
To perishof Delight
Its all I have to bring today

This and my heart and all the fields
And all the meadows wide
Be sure you countshould I forget
Some one the sum could tell
This and my heart and all the Bees

Chooses its latch from all the other fastenings

Could scarce afford Eternity

But His Perturbless Plan

A fashionless delight
Its like the bee

It sifts from Leaden Sieves
It powders all the Wood
It fills with Alabaster Wool
The Wrinkles of the Road
It makes an Even Face
Of Mountain and of Plain
Unbroken Forehead from the East
Unto the East again
It reaches to the Fence
It wraps it Rail by Rail
Till it is lost in Fleeces
It deals Celestial Vail
To Stump and Stackand Stem
A Summers empty Room
Acres of Joints where Harvests were
Recordless but for them
It Ruffles Wrists of Posts
As Ankles of a Queen
Then stills its Artisanslike Ghosts
Denying they have been
It sounded as if the Streets were running
And then the Streets stood still
Eclipse was all we could see at the Window
And Awe was all we could feel
By and by the boldest stole out of his Covert
To see if Time was there
Nature was in an Opal Apron
Mixing fresher Air
It stole along so stealthy
Suspicion it was done
Was dim as to the wealthy
Beginning not to own
It struck me every day
The lightning was as new
As if the cloud that instant slit
And let the fire through
It burned me in the night
It blistered in my dream
It sickened fresh upon my sight
With every mornings beam
I thought that storm was brief
The maddest quickest by
But Nature lost the date of this
And left it in the sky
It tossedand tossed
A little Brig I knewoertook by Blast
It spunand spun
And groped delirious for Morn
It slippedand slipped
As One that drunkenstept
Its white foot tripped
Then dropped from sight
Ah BrigGood Night
To Crew and You
The Oceans Heart too smoothtoo Blue
To break for You
It troubled me as once I was
For I was once a Child
Concluding how an Atomfell
And yet the Heavensheld
The Heavens weighed the mostby far
Yet Blueand solidstood
Without a Boltthat I could prove
Would Giantsunderstand
Life set me largerproblems
Some I shall keepto solve
Till Algebra is easier
Or simpler provedabove
Thentoom dashbe comprehended
What sorerpuzzled me
Why Heaven did not break away
And tumbleBlueon me
It was a Grave yet bore no Stone
Enclosed twas not of Rail
A Consciousness its Acre and
It held a Human Soul
Entombed by whom for what offence
If Home or Foreign born
Had I the curiosity
Twere not appeased of men
Till Resurrection I must guess
Denied the small desire
A Rose upon its Ridge to sow
Or take away a Briar
It was given to me by the Gods
When I was a little Girl
They given us Presents mostyou know
When we are newand small
I kept it in my Hand
I never put it down
I did not dare to eator sleep
For fear it would be gone
I heard such words as Rich
When hurrying to school
From lips at Corners of the Streets
And wrestled with a smile
Rich Twas Myselfwas rich
To take the name of Gold
And Gold to ownin solid Bars
The Differencemade me bold
It was not death for I stood up
And all the dead lie down
It was not night for all the bells
Put out their tongues for noon
It was not frost for on my flesh
I felt siroccos crawl
Nor fire for just my marble feet
Could keep a chancel cool
And yet it tasted like them all
The figures I have seen
Set orderly for burial
Reminded me of mine
As if my life were shaven
And fitted to a frame
And could not breathe without a key
And t was like midnight some
When everything that ticked has stopped
And space stares all around
Or grisly frosts first autumn morns
Repeal the beating ground
But most like chaosstopless cool
Without a chance or spar
Or even a report of land
To justify despair
It was too late for Man
But early yet for God
Creationimpotent to help
But PrayerremainedOur Side
How excellent the Heaven
When Earthcannot be had
How hospitablethenthe face
Of our Old NeighborGod
It will be Summereventually
Ladieswith parasols
Sauntering Gentlemenwith Canes
And little Girlswith Dolls
Will tint the pallid landscape
As twere a bright Bouquet
Thro drifted deep in Parian
The Village liestoday
The Lilacsbending many a year
Will sway with purple load
The Beeswill not despise the tune
Their Forefathershave hummed
The Wild Roseredden in the Bog
The Asteron the Hill
Her everlasting fashionset
And Covenant Gentiansfrill
Till Summer folds her miracle
As Womendotheir Gown
Of Priestsadjust the Symbols
When Sacramentis done
It would have starved a Gnat
To live so small as I
And yet I was a living Child
With Foods necessity
Upon melike a Claw
I could no more remove
Than I could coax a Leech away
Or make a Dragonmove
Not like the Gnathad I
The privilege to fly
And seek a Dinner for myself
How mightier Hethan I
Nor like Himselfthe Art
Upon the Window Pane
To gad my little Being out
And not beginagain
It would never be CommonmoreI said
Differencehad begun
Many a bitternesshad been
But that old sortwas done
Orif it sometimeshowedas twill

Such blisshad Ifor all the years

Upon my simple Cheek

Twas needlessany speak

The feetI former used
Unnecessarynow to me
As bootswould beto Birds
I put my pleasure all abroad
I dealth a word of Gold
To every Creaturethat I met
And Doweredall the World
Whensuddenlymy Riches shrank
A Goblindrank my Dew
My Palacesdropped tenantless
Myselfwas beggaredtoo
I clutched at sounds
I groped at shapes
I touched the tops of Films
I felt the Wilderness roll back
Along my Golden lines
The Sackclothhangs upon the nail
The Frock I used to wear
But where my moment of Brocade

Jesus thy Crucifix
Enable thee to guess
The smaller size
Jesus thy second face
Mind thee in Paradise
Of ours
Joy to have merited the Pain
To merit the Release
Joy to have perished every step
To Compass Paradise
Pardonto look upon thy face
With these old fashioned Eyes
Better than newcould befor that
Though bought in Paradise
Because they looked on thee before
And thou hast looked on them
Prove MeMy Hazel Witnesses
The features are the same
So fleet thou wert when present
So infinitewhen gone
An Orients Apparition
Remanded of the Morn
The Height I recollect
Twas even with the Hills
The Depth upon my Soul was notched
As Floodson Whites of Wheels
To Haunttill Time have dropped
His last Decade away
And Haunting actualizeto last
At leastEternity
Judgment is justest
When the Judged
His action laid away
Divested is of every Disk
But his sincerity
Honor is then the safest hue
In a posthumous Sun
Not any color will endure
That scrutiny can burn
Just as He spoke it from his Hands
This Edifice remain
A Turret more a Turret less
Dishonor his Design
According as his skill prefer
It perish or endure
Content soeer it ornament
His absent character
Just lost when I was saved
Just felt the world go by
Just girt me for the onset with Eternity
When breath blew back
And on the other side
I heard recede the disappointed tide
Therefore as One returned I feel
Odd secrets of the line to tell
Some Sailor skirting foreign shores
Some pale Reporter from the awful doors
Before the Seal
Next time to stay
Next time the things to see
By Ear unheard
Unscrutinized by Eye
Next time to tarry
While the Ages steal
Slow tramp the Centuries
And the Cycles wheel
Kill your Balmand its Odors bless you
Bare your Jessamineto the storm
And she will fling her maddest perfume
Haplyyour Summer night to Charm
Stab the Birdthat built in your bosom
Oh could you catch her last Refrain
Bubble forgiveSome betterBubble
Carol for Himwhen I am gone
Knows how to forget
But could It teach it
Easiest of Arts they say
When one learn how
Dull Hearts have died

Sacrificed for Science

But was not wiser
Globe did not teach it
Nor Logarithm Show

It can be had on Window Panes
Some Hours in the Day
But not for Compensation
It holds as large a Glow
To Squirrel in the Himmaleh
Precisely as to you
Lightly stepped a yellow star
To its lofty place
Loosed the Moon her silver hat
From her lustral Face
All of Evening softly lit
As an Astral Hall
Father I observed to Heaven
You are punctual
Like Brooms of Steel
The Snow and Wind
Had swept the Winter Street
The House was hooked
The Sun sent out
Faint Deputies of Heat
Where rode the Bird
The Silence tied
His ample plodding Steed
The Apple in the Cellar snug
Was all the one that played
Like eyes that looked on Wastes
Incredulous of Ought
But Blankand steady Wilderness
Diversified by Night
Just Infinites of Nought
As far as it could see
So looked the face I looked upon
So looked itselfon Me
I offered it no Help
Because the Cause was Mine
The Misery a Compact
As hopelessas divine
Neitherwould be absolved
Neither would be a Queen
Without the OtherTherefore
We perishtho We reign
Like Flowers that heard the news of Dews
But never deemed the dripping prize
Awaited theirlow Brows
Or Beesthat thought the Summers name
Some rumor of Delirium
No Summercouldfor Them
Or Arctic Creatures dimly stirred
By Tropic Hintsome Travelled Bird
Imported to the Wood
Or Winds bright signal to the Ear
Making that homely and severe
Contented known before
The Heavenunexpected come
To Lives that thought the Worshipping
A too presumptuous Psalm
Like her the Saints retire
In their Chapeaux of fire
Martial as she
Like her the Evenings steal
Purple and Cochineal
After the Day
Departedboth they say
ie gathered away
Not found
Argues the Aster still
Reasons the Daffodil
Profound
Like Mighty Foot Lightsburned the Red
At Bases of the Trees
The far Theatricals of Day
Exhibitingto These

While Chiefestof the Crowd
Enabled by his Royal Dress
Myself distinguished God
Like Some Old fashioned Miracle
When Summertime is done
Seems Summers Recollection
And the Affairs of June
As infinite Tradition
As Cinderellas Bays
Or Little Johnof Lincoln Green
Or Blue Beards Galleries
Her Bees have a fictitious Hum
Her Blossoms like a Dream
Elate ustill we almost weep
So plausiblethey seem
Her Memories like StrainsReview
When Orchestra is dumb
The Violin in Baize replaced
And Earand Heavennumb
Like trains of cars on tracks of plush
I hear the level bee
A jar across the flowers goes
Their velvet masonry
Withstands until the sweet assault
Their chivalry consumes
While he victorious tilts away
To vanquish other blooms
His feet are shod with gauze
His helmet is of gold
His breast a single onyx
With chrysoprase inlaid
His labor is a chant
His idleness a tune
Oh for a bees experience
Of clovers and of noon
Lives he in any other world
My faith cannot reply
Before it was imperative
Twas all distinct to me
Longing is like the Seed
That wrestles in the Ground
Believing if it intercede
It shall at length be found
The Hour and the Clime
Each Circumstance unknown
What Constancy must be achieved
Before it see the Sun
Loveis anterior to Life
Posteriorto Death
Initial of Creation and
The Exponent of Earth
Loveis that later Thing than Death
More previousthan Life
Confirms it at its entranceAnd
Usurps itof itself
Tastes Deaththe firstto hand the sting
The Secondto its friend
Disarms the little interval
Deposits Him with God
Then hoversan inferior Guard
Lest this Beloved Charge

A smaller than the Large
Loveis anterior to Life

The Exponent of Earth

Low at my problem bending
Another problem comes
Larger than mineSerener
Involving statelier sums
I check my busy pencil
My figures file away
Wherefore my baffled fingers
They perplexity
Luck is not chance
Its Toil
Fortunes expensive smile
Is earned
The Father of the Mine
Is that oldfashioned Coin
We spurned
Make me a picture of the sun
So I can hang it in my room
And make believe Im getting warm
When others call it Day
Draw me a Robinon a stem
So I am hearing him Ill dream
And when the Orchards stop their tune
Put my pretenseaway
Say if its reallywarm at noon
Whether its Buttercupsthat skim
Or Butterfliesthat bloom
Thenskipthe frostupon the lea
And skip the Russeton the tree
Lets play thosenever come
Mama never forgets her birds
Though in another tree
She looks down just as often
And just as tenderly
As when her little mortal nest
With cunning care she wove
If either of her sparrows fall
She notices above
Many a phrase has the English language
I have heard but one
Low as the laughter of the Cricket
Loud as the Thunders Tongue
Murmuring like old Caspian Choirs
When the Tides a lull
Saying itself in new infection
Like a Whippoorwill
Breaking in bright Orthography
On my simple sleep
Thundering its Prospective
Till I stir and weep
Not for the Sorrow done me
But the push of Joy
Say it again Saxton
HushOnly to me
Many cross the Rhine
In this cup of mine
Sip old Frankfort air
From my brown Cigar
March is the Month of Expectation
The things we do not know
The Persons of prognostication
Are coming now
We try to show becoming firmness
But pompous Joy
Betrays us as his first Betrothal
Betrays a Boy
Pink small and punctual
Aromatic low
Covert in April
Candid in May

Dear to the moss
Known by the knoll
Next to the robin
In every human soul

Bold little beauty
Bedecked with thee
Nature forswears
Antiquity
Me change Me alter
Then I will when on the Everlasting Hill
A Smaller Purple grows
At sunset or a lesser glow
Flickers upon Cordillera
At Days superior close
Me Come My dazzled face
In such a shining place
Me Hear My foreign ear
The sounds of welcome near
The saints shall meet
Our bashful feet
My holiday shall be
That they remember me
My paradise the fame
That they pronounce my name
Me from Myselfto banish
Had I Art
Impregnable my Fortress
Unto All Heart
But since Myselfassault Me
How have I peace
Except by subjugating
Consciousness
And since Were mutual Monarch
How this be
Except by Abdication
Meof Me
Me prove it nowWhoever doubt
Me stop to prove itnow
Make hastethe Scruple Death be scant
For Opportunity
The River reaches to my feet
As yetMy Heart be dry
Oh LoverLife could not convince
Might Deathenable Thee
The River reaches to My Breast
StillstillMy Hands above
Proclaim with their remaining Might
Dost recognize the Love
The River reaches to my Mouth
Rememberwhen the Sea
Swept by my searching eyesthe last
Themselves were quickwith Thee
Midsummer was it when They died
A full and perfect time
The Summer closed upon itself
In Consummated Bloom
The Corn her furthest kernel filled
Before the coming Flail
When Theseleaned unto Perfectness
Through Haze of Burial

Mineby the Royal Seal
Mineby the Sign in the Scarlet prison

TiltedConfirmed
Delirious Charter
Minelong as Ages steal
MINE enemy is growing old
I have at last revenge
The palate of the hate departs
If any would avenge

Let him be quick the viand flits
It is a faded meat
Anger as soon as fed is dead
T is starving makes it fat
More Lifewent outwhen He went
Than Ordinary Breath
Lit with a finer Phosphor
Requiring in the Quench
A Power of Renowned Cold
The Climate of the Grave
A Temperature just adequate
So Anthracite to live
For somean Ampler Zero
A Frost more needle keen
Is necessary to reduce
The Ethiop within

A Gnats minutest Fan
Sufficient to obliterate
A Tract of Citizen

Morns like thesewe parted
Noons like theseshe rose
Fluttering firstthen firmer
To her fair repose
Never did she lisp it
It was not for me
Shewas mute from transport
Ifrom agony
Tillthe evening nearing
One the curtains drew
Quick A Sharper rustling
And this linnet flew
Most she touched me by her muteness
Most she won me by the way
She presented her small figure
Plea itselffor Charity
Were a Crumb my whole possession
Were there famine in the land
Were it my resource from starving
Could I such a plea withstand
Not upon her knee to thank me
Sank this Beggar from the Sky
But the Crumb partookdeparted
And returned On High
I supposedwhen sudden
Such a Praise began
Twas as Space sat singing
To herselfand men
Twas the Winged Beggar
Afterward I learned
To her Benefactor
Making Gratitude
Much Madness is divinest Sense
To a discerning Eye
Much Sense the starkest Madness
Tis the Majority
In this as All prevail
Assent and you are sane
Demur youre straightaway dangerous
And handled with a Chain
Musicians wrestle everywhere
All dayamong the crowded air
I hear the silver strife
Andwalkinglong before the morn
Such transport breaks upon the town
I think it that New Life
If is not Birdit has no nest
Nor Bandin brass and scarletdrest
Nor Tamborinnor Man
It is not Hymn from pulpit read
The Morning Stars the Treble led
On Times first Afternoon
Somesayit is the Spheresat play
Some say that bright Majority
Of vanished Damesand Men
Somethink it service in the place
Where wewith latecelestial face
Please Godshall Ascertain
Must be a Woe
A loss or so
To bend the eye
Best Beautys way
Butonce aslant
It notes Delight
As difficult
As Stalactite
A Common Bliss
Were had for less
The priceis
Even as the Grace
Our lordthought no
Extravagance
To paya Cross
Mute thy Coronation
Meek my Vive le roi
Fold a tiny courtier
In thine Ermine Sir
There to rest revering
Till the pageant by
I can murmur broken
Master It was I
My best Acquaintances are those
With Whom I spoke no Word
The Stars that stated come to Town
Esteemed Me never rude
Although to their Celestial Call
I failed to make reply
My constantreverential Face
Sufficient Courtesy
MY cocoon tightens colors tease
I m feeling for the air
A dim capacity for wings
Degrades the dress I wear

A power of butterfly must be
The aptitude to fly
Meadows of majesty concedes
And easy sweeps of sky

So I must baffle at the hint
And cipher at the sign
And make much blunder if at last
I take the clew divine
My Eye is fuller than my vase
Her Cargois of Dew
And stillmy Heartmy Eye outweighs
East Indiafor you
My Faith is larger than the Hills
So when the Hills decay
My Faith must take the Purple Wheel
To show the Sun the way
Tis first He steps upon the Vane
And thenupon the Hill
And then abroad the World He go
To do His Golden Will
And if His Yellow feet should miss
The Bird would not arise
The Flowers would slumber on their Stems
No Bells have Paradise
How dare I therefore stint a faith
On which so vast depends
Lest Firmament should fail for me
The Rivet in the Bands
My first well Daysince many ill
I asked to go abroad
And take the Sunshine in my hands
And see the things in Pod
A blossom just when I went in
To take my Chance with pain
Uncertain if myself or He
Should prove the strongest One
The Summer deepened while we strove
She put some flowers away
And Redder cheeked Onesin their stead
A fondillusive way
To cheat Herself it seemed she tried
As if before a child
To fadeTomorrowRainbows held
The Sepulchre could hide
She dealt a fashion to the Nut
She tied the Hoods to Seeds
She dropped bright scraps of Tint about
And left Brazilian Threads
On every shoulder that she met
Then both her Hands of Haze
Put upto hide her parting Grace
From our unfitted eyes
My loss by sicknessWas it Loss
Or that Ethereal Gain
One earns by measuring the Grave
Thenmeasuring the Sun
My friend attacks my friend
Oh Battle picturesque
Then I turn Soldier too
And he turns Satirist
How martial is this place
Had I a mighty gun
I think Id shoot the human race
And then to glory run
My friend must be a Bird
Because it flies
Mortal my friend must be
Because it dies
Barbs has it like a Bee
Ah curious friend
Thou puzzlest me
My Gardenlike the Beach
Denotes there bea Sea
Thats Summer
Such as Thesethe Pearls
She fetchessuch as Me
My life closed twice before its close
It yet remains to see
If Immortality unveil
A third event to me
So huge so hopeless to conceive
As these that twice befell
Parting is all we know of heaven
And all we need of hell
My life had stooda Loaded Gun
In Cornerstill a Day
The Owner passedidentified
And carried Me away
And now We roam in Sovereign Woods
And now We hunt the Doe
And every time I speak for Him
The Mountains straight reply
And do I smile such cordial light
Upon the Valley glow
It is as a Vesuvian face
Had let its pleasure through
And when at NightOur good Day done
I guard My Masters Head
Tis better than the EiderDucks
Deep Pillowto have shared
To foe of HisIm deadly foe
None stir the second time
On whom I lay a Yellow Eye
Or an emphatic Thumb
Though I than Hemay longer live
He longer mustthan I
For I have but the power to kill
Withoutthe power to die
My nosegays are for captives
Dim longexpectant eyes
Fingers denied the plucking
Patient till paradise
To such if they should whisper
Of morning and the moor
They bear no other errand
And I no other prayer
My period had come for Prayer
No other Artwould do
My Tactics missed a rudiment
CreatorWas it you
God grows aboveso those who pray
Horizonsmust ascend
And so I stepped upon the North
To see this Curious Friend
His House was notno sign had He
By Chimneynor by Door
Could I infer his Residence
Vast Prairies of Air
Unbroken by a Settler
Were all that I could see
InfinitudeHadst Thou no Face
That I might look on Thee
The Silence condescended
Creation stoppedfor Me
But awed beyond my errand
I worshippeddid not pray
My Portion is Defeattoday
A paler luck than Victory
Less Paeansfewer Bells
The Drums dont follow Mewith tunes
Defeata somewhat slowermeans
More Arduous than Balls
Tis populous with Bone and stain
And Men too straight to stoop again
And Piles of solid Moan
And Chips of Blankin Boyish Eyes
And scraps of Prayer
And Deaths surprise
Stamped visiblein Stone
Theres somewhat prouder over there
The Trumpets tell it to the Air
How different Victory
To Him who has itand the One
Who to have had it would have been
Contenderto die
My Reward for Being was This
My premiumMy Bliss
An Admiralty less
A Sceptrepenniless
And Realmsjust Dross
When Thrones accost my Hands
With Me Miss Me
Ill unroll Thee
Dominions dowerlessbeside this Grace

The Ballots of Eternity will show just that
My River runs to thee
Blue Sea Wilt welcome me
My River wait reply
Oh Sealook graciously
Ill fetch thee Brooks
From spotted nooks

My Soulaccused meAnd I quailed
As Tongue of Diamond had reviled
All else accused meand I smiled
My Soulthat Morningwas My friend
Her favoris the best Disdain
Toward Artifice of Timeor Men
But Her Disdaintwere lighter bear
A finger of Enamelled Fire
My wheel is in the dark
I cannot see a spoke
Yet know its dripping feet
Go round and round
My foot is on the Tide
An unfrequented road
Yet have all roads
A clearing at the end
Some have resigned the Loom
Some in the busy tomb
Find quaint employ
Some with newstately feet
Pass royal through the gate
Flinging the problem back
At you and I
My Worthiness is all my Doubt
His Meritall my fear
Contrasting which my quality
Do lowlierappear
Lest I should insufficient prove
For His beloved Need
The Chiefest Apprehension
Upon my thronging Mind
Tis truethat Deity to stoop
Inherently incline
For nothing higher than Itself
Itself can rest upon
So Ithe undivine abode
Of His Elect Content
Conform my Soulas twere a Church

No Notice gave She but a Change
No Message but a Sigh
For Whom the Time did not suffice
That She should specify
She was not warm though Summer shone
Nor scrupulous of cold
Though Rime by Rime the steady Frost
Upon Her Bosom piled
Of shrinking waysshe did not fright
Though all the Village looked
But held Her gravity aloft
And met the gazedirect
And when adjusted like a Seed
In careful fitted Ground
Unto the Everlasting Spring
And hindered but a Mound
Her Warm return if so she chose
And Weimploring drew
Removed our invitation by
As Some She never knew

Captivity is Consciousness

No Romance sold unto
Could so enthrall a Man
As the perusal of
His Individual One
Tis FictionsWhen tis small enough
To CreditTisnt true
Nobody knows this little Rose
It might a pilgrim be
Did I not take it from the ways
And lift it up to thee
Only a Bee will miss it
Only a Butterfly
Hastening from far journey
On its breast to lie
Only a Bird will wonder
Only a Breeze will sigh
Ah Little Rosehow easy
For such as thee to die
None can experience sting
Who Bountyhave not known
The fact of Faminecould not be
Except for Fact of Corn
Wantis a meagre Art
Acquired by Reverse
The Poverty that was not Wealth
Cannot be Indigence
Noonis the Hinge of Day
Eveningthe Tissue Door
Morningthe East compelling the sill
Till all the World is ajar
Not all die early dying young
Maturity of Fate
Is consummated equally
In Ages or a Night
A Hoary Boy Ive known to drop
Whole staturedby the side
Of Junior of Fourscoretwas Act
Not Periodthat died
Not any sunny tone
From any fervent zone
Find entrance there
Better a grave of Balm
Toward human natures home
And Robins near
Than a stupendous Tomb
Proclaiming to the Gloom
How dead we are
Not in this world to see his face
Sounds long until I read the place
Where this is said to be
But just the primer to a life
Unopened rare upon the shelf
Clasped yet to him and me
And yet my primer suits me so
I would not choose a book to know
Than that be sweeter wise
Might some one else so learned be
And leave me just my A B C
Himself could have the skies
Not probableThe barest Chance
A smile too fewa word too much
And far from Heaven as the Rest
The Soul so close on Paradise
What if the Bird from journey far
Confused by Sweetsas Mortalsare
Forget the secret of His wing
And perishbut a Bough between
Oh Groping feet
Oh Phantom Queen
Not Revelationtisthat waits
But our unfurnished eyes
Not Sickness stains the Brave
Nor any Dart
Nor Doubt of Scene to come
But an adjourning Heart
Not that We did shall be the test
When Act and Will are done
But what Our Lord infers We would
Had We diviner been
Not with a club the Heart is broken
Nor with a stone
A whip so small you could not see it
Ive known

To lash the magic creature
Till it fell
Yet that whips name too noble
Then to tell

Magnanimous of bird
By boy descried
To sing unto the stone
Of which it died
Next The Only News I know
Not Revelationtisthat waits
But our unfurnished eyes
Of all the souls that stand create
I have elected one
When sense from spirit files away
And subterfuge is done
When that which is and that which was
Apart intrinsic stand
And this brief tragedy of flesh
Is shifted like a sand
When figures show their royal front
And mists are carved sway
Behold the atom I Feferred
To all the lists of clay
Of all the Sounds despatched abroad
Theres not a Charge to me
Like that old measure in the Boughs
That phraseless Melody
The Wind doesworking like a Hand
Whose fingers Comb the Sky
Then quiver downwith tufts of Tune
Permitted Gods and me
Inheritance it is to us
Beyond the Art to Earn
Beyond the trait to take away
By Robber since the Gain
Is gotten not of fingers
And inner than the Bone
Hid golden for the whole of Days
And even in the Urn
I cannot vouch the merry Dust
Do not arise and play
In some odd fashion of its own
Some quainter Holiday
When Winds go round and round in Bands
And thrum upon the door
And Birds take places overhead
To bear them Orchestra
I crave Him grace of Summer Boughs
If such an Outcast be
Who never heard that fleshless Chant
Risesolemnon the Tree
As if some Caravan of Sound
Off Deserts in the Sky
Had parted Rank
Then knit and swept
In Seamless Company
Of Being is a Bird
The likest to the Down
An Easy Breeze do put afloat
The General Heavensupon
It soarsand shiftsand whirls
And measures with the Clouds
In easyevendazzling pace
No different the Birds
Except a Wake of Music
Accompany their feet
As did the Down emit a Tune
For Ecstasyof it
Of Bronzeand Blaze
The NorthTonight
So adequateit forms
So preconcerted with itself
So distantto alarms
And Unconcern so sovereign
To Universe or me
Infects my simple spirit
With Taints of Majesty
Till I take vaster attitudes
And strut upon my stem
Disdaining Men and Oxygen
For Arrogance of them
My Splendors are Menagerie
But their Completeless Show
Will entertain the Centuries
When I am long ago
An Island in dishonored Grass
Whom none but Beetlesknow
Of Brusselsit was not
Of Kidderminster Nay
The Winds did buy it of the Woods
Theysold it unto me
It was a gentle price
The poorestcould afford
It was within the frugal purse
Of Beggaror of Bird
Of small and spicy Yards
In huea mellow Dun
Of Sunshineand of SereComposed
But principallyof Sun
The Windunrolled it fast
And spread it on the Ground
Upholsterer of the Pinesis He
Upholstererof the Pond
Of Consciousness her awful Mate
The Soul cannot be rid
As easy the secreting her
Behind the Eyes of God
The deepest hid is sighted first
And scant to Him the Crowd
What triple Lenses burn upon
The Escapade from God
Of CourseI prayed
And did God Care
He cared as much as on the Air
A Birdhad stamped her foot
And cried Give Me
My ReasonLife
I had not hadbut for Yourself
Twere better Charity
To leave me in the Atoms Tomb
Merry and Nought and gay and numb
Than this smart Misery
Of nearness to her sundered Things
The Soul has special times
When Dimnesslooks the Oddity
Distinctnesseasyse ems
The Shapes we buried dwell about
Familiar in the Rooms
Untarnished by the Sepulchre
The Mouldering Playmate comes
In just the Jacket that he wore
Long buttoned in the Mold
Since weold mornings Childrenplayed
Dividedby a world
The Grave yields back her Robberies
The Years our pilfered Things
Bright Knots of Apparitions
Salute us with their wings
As weit werethat perished
Themselfhad just remained till we rejoin them
And twas they and not ourself
That mourned
Of Silken Speech and Specious Shoe
A Traitor is the Bee
His service to the newest Grace
Present continually
His Suit a chance
His Troth a Term
Protracted as the Breeze
Continual Ban propoundeth He
Continual Divorce
Of so divine a Loss
We enter but the Gain
Indemnity for Loneliness
That such a Bliss has been
Of Tolling Bell I ask the cause
A Soul has gone to Heaven
Im answered in a lonesome tone
Is Heaven then a Prison
That Bells should ring till all should know
A Soul had gone to Heaven
Would seem to me the more the way
A Good News should be given
Of Tribulation these are They
Denoted by the White
The Spangled Gowns a lesser Rank
Of Victorsdesignate
All thesedid conquer
But the ones who overcame most times
Wear nothing commoner than Snow
No Ornament but Palms
Surrenderis a sort unknown
On this superior soil
Defeatan outgrown Anguish
Remembered as the Mile
Our panting Ankle barely passed
When Night devoured the Road
But westood whispering in the House
And all we saidwas Saved
Nature rarer uses Yellow
Than another Hue
Saves she all of that for Sunsets
Prodigal of Blue
Spending Scarlet like a Woman
Yellow she affords
Only scantly and selectly
Like a Lovers Words
Oh Shadow on the Grass
Art thou a Step or not
Go make thee fair my Candidate
My nominated Heart
Oh Shadow on the Grass
While I delay to guess
Some other thou wilt consecrate
Oh Unelected Face
On a Columnar Self
How ample to rely
In Tumultor Extremity
How good the Certainty
That Lever cannot pry
And Wedge cannot divide
ConvictionThat Granitic Base
Though None be on our Side
Suffice Usfor a Crowd
Ourselfand Rectitude
And that Assemblynot far off
From furthest SpiritGod
On my volcano grows the Grass
A meditative spot
An acre for a Bird to choose
Would be the General thought
How red the Fire rocks below
How insecure the sod
Did I disclose
Would populate with awe my solitude
On such a night or such a night
Would anybody care
If such a little figure
Slipped quiet from its chair
So quietOh how quiet
That nobody might know
But that the little figure
Rocked softerto and fro
On such a dawn or such a dawn
Would anybody sigh
That such a little figure
Too sound asleep did lie
For Chanticleer to wake it
Or stirring house below
Or giddy bird in orchard
Or early task to do
There was a little figure plump
For every little knoll
Busy needles and spools of thread
And trudging feet from school
Playmates and holidays and nuts
And visions vast and small
Strange that the feet so precious charged
Should reach so small a goal
On that dear Frame the Years had worn
Yet precious as the House
In which We first experienced Light
The Witnessing to Us
Precious It was conceiveless fair
As Hands the Grave had grimed
Should softly place within our own
Denying that they died
On this long storm the Rainbow rose
On this late Mornthe Sun
The cloudslike listless Elephants
Horizonsstraggled down
The Birds rose smiling in their nests
The galesindeedwere done
Alas how heedless were the eyes
On whom the summer shone
The quiet nonchalance of death
No Daybreakcan bestir
The slowArchangels syllables
Must awaken her
On this wondrous sea
Sailing silently
Ho Pilot ho
Knowest thou the shore
Where no breakers roar
Where the storm is oer
In the peaceful west
Many the sails at rest
The anchors fast
Thither I pilot thee
Land Ho Eternity
Ashore at last
Once more my now bewildered Dove
Bestirs her puzzled wings
Once more her mistress on the deep
Her troubled question flings
Thrice to the floating casement
The Patriarchs bird returned
Courage My brave Columba
There may yet be Land
One and Oneare One
Twobe finished using
Well enough for Schools
But for Minor Choosing
Lifejustor Death
Or the Everlasting
Morewould be too vast
For the Souls Comprising
One Anguishin a Crowd
A Minor thingit sounds
And yet unto the single Doe
Attempted of the Hounds
Tis Terror as consummate
As Legions of Alarm
Did leap full flanked upon the Host
Tis Unitsmake the Swarm
A Small Leechon the Vitals
The sliver in the Lung
The Bung outof an Artery
Are scarce accountedHarms
Yet mightby relation
To that Repealless thing
A Beingimpotent to end
When once it has begun
One Blessing had I than the rest
So larger to my Eyes
That I stopped gaugingsatisfied
For this enchanted size
It was the limit of my Dream
The focus of my Prayer
A perfectparalyzing Bliss
Contented as Despair
I knew no more of Wantor Cold
Phantasms both become
For this new Value in the Soul
Supremest Earthly Sum
The Heaven below the Heaven above
Obscured with ruddier Blue
Lifes Latitudes leant overfull
The Judgment perishedtoo
Why Bliss so scantily disburse
Why Paradise defer
Why Floods be served to Usin Bowls
I speculate no more
One Crucifixion is recordedonly
How many be
Is not affirmed of Mathematics
Or History
One Calvaryexhibited to Stranger
As many be
As personsor Peninsulas
Gethsemane
Is but a Provincein the Beings Centre
Judea
For Journeyor Crusades Achieving
Too near
Our Lordindeedmade Compound Witness
And yet
Theres newernearer Crucifixion
Than That
One Day is there of the Series
Termed Thanksgiving Day
Celebrated part at Table
Part in Memory
Neither Patriarch nor Pussy
I dissect the Play
Seems it to my Hooded thinking
Reflex Holiday
Had there been no sharp Subtraction
From the early Sum
Not an Acre or a Caption
Where was once a Room
Not a Mention whose small Pebble
Wrinkled any Sea
Unto Such were such Assembly
Twere Thanksgiving Day
One dignity delays for all
One mitred Afternoon
None can avoid this purple
None evade this Crown
Coach it insures and footmen
Chamber and state and throng
Bells also in the village
As we ride grand along
What dignified Attendants
What service when we pause
How loyally at parting
Their hundred hats they raise
Her pomp surpassing ermine
When simple You and I
Present our meek escutheon
And claim the rank to die
One Life of so much Consequence
Yet Ifor itwould pay
My Souls entire income
In ceaselesssalary
One Pearlto meso signal
That I would instant dive
AlthoughI knewto take it
Would cost mejust a life
The Sea is fullI know it
Thatdoes not blur my Gem
It burnsdistinct from all the row
Intactin Diadem
The life is thickI know it
Yetnot so dense a crowd
But Monarchsare perceptible
Far down the dustiest Road
One need not be a chamber to be haunted
One need not be a house
The brain has corridors surpassing
Material place
Far safer of a midnight meeting
External ghost
Than an interior confronting
That whiter host
Far safer through an Abbey gallop
The stones achase
Than moonless ones own self encounter
In lonesome place
Ourself behind ourself concealed
Should startle most
Assassin hid in our apartment
Be horrors least
The prudent carries a revolver
He bolts the door
Oerlooking a superior spectre
More near
One Sister have I in our house
And one a hedge away
Theres only one recorded
But both belong to me
One came the road that I came
And wore my last years gown
The other as a bird her nest
Builded our hearts among
She did not sing as we did
It was a different tune
Herself to her a music
As Bumble bee of June
Today is far from Childhood
But up and down the hills
I held her hand the tighter
Which shortened all the miles
And still her hum
The years among
Deceives the Butterfly
Still in her Eye
The Violets lie
Mouldered this many May
I spilt the dew
But took the morn
I chose this single star
From out the wide nights numbers
Sue forevermore
One Year agojots what

Our journey had advanced
Our feet were almost come
To that odd fork in Beings road
Eternity by term
Our pace took sudden awe
Our feet reluctant led
Before were cities but between
The forest of the dead
Retreat was out of hope
Behind a sealed route
Eternitys white flag before
And God at every gate
Our little Kinsmenafter Rain
In plenty may be seen
A Pink and Pulpy multitude
The tepid Ground upon
A needless life it seemed to me
Until a little Bird
As to a Hospitality
Advanced and breakfasted
As I of He so God of Me
I pondered may have judged
And left the little Angle Worm
With Modesties enlarged
Our lives are Swiss
So still so Cool
Till some odd afternoon
The Alps neglect their Curtains
And we look farther on
Italy stands the other side
While like a guard between
The solemn Alps
The siren Alps
Forever intervene
Our share of night to bear
Our share of morning
Our blank in bliss to fill
Our blank in scorning
Here a star and there a star
Some lose their way
Here a mist and there a mist

A Mansion for the Rat
Snug in seraphic Cupboards
To nibble all the day
While unsuspecting Cycles
Wheel solemnly away
THE LARGEST fire ever known
Occurs each afternoon
Discovered is without surprise
Proceeds without concern
Consumes and no report to men
An Occidental town
Rebuilt another morning
To be again burned down

The Bells a Winter Night
Bearing the Neighbor out of Sound
That never did alight
Perhaps I asked too large
I take no less than skies
For Earths grow thick as
Berries in my native town
My Basked holds just Firmaments
Those dangle easy on my arm
But smaller bundles Cram
Perhaps youd like to buy a flower
But I could never sell
If you would like to borrow
Until the Daffodil
Unties her yellow Bonnet
Beneath the village door
Until the Bees from Clover rows
Their Hock and Sherry draw
Why I will lend until just then
But not an hour more
Perhaps you think me stooping
Im not ashamed of that
Christstooped until He touched the Grave
Do those at Sacrament
Commemorative Dishonor
Or love annealed of love
Until it bend as low as Death
Redignified above
Pigmy seraphsgone astray
Velvet people from Vevay
Balles from some lost summer day
Bees exclusive Coterie
Paris could not lay the fold
Belted down with Emerald
Venice could not show a check
Of a tint so lustrous meek
Never such an Ambuscade
As of briar and leaf displayed
For my little damask maid
I had rather wear her grace
Than an Earls distinguished face
I had rather dwell like her
Than be Duke of Exeter
Royalty enough for me
To subdue the Bumblebee
Poor little Heart
Did they forget thee
Then dinna care Then dinna care
Proud little Heart
Did they forsake thee
Be debonnaire Be debonnaire
Frail little Heart
I would not break thee
Couldst credit me Couldst credit me
Gay little Heart
Like Morning Glory
Wind and Sunwilt thee array
Portraits are to daily faces
As an Evening West
To a fine pedantic sunshine
In a satin Vest
Praise it tis dead
It cannot glow
Warm this inclement Ear
With the encomium it earned
Since it was gathered here
Invest this alabaster Zest
In the Delights of Dust
Remitted since it flitted it
In recusance august
Prayer is the little implement
Through which Men reach
Where Presenceis denied them
They fling their Speech
By means of itin Gods Ear
If then He hear
This sums the Apparatus
Comprised in Prayer
Precious to MeShe still shall be
Though She forget the name I bear
The fashion of the Gown I wear
The very Color of My Hair
So like the Meadowsnow
I dared to show a Tress of Theirs
If haplyShe might not despise
A Buttercups Array
I know the Wholeobscures the Part
The fractionthat appeased the Heart
Till Numbers Empery
Rememberedas the Millners flower
When Summers Everlasting Dower
Confronts the dazzled Bee
Presentiment is that long shadow on the lawn
Indicative that suns go down
The notice to the startled grass
That darkness is about to pass
Promise ThisWhen You be Dying
Some shall summon Me
Mine belong Your latest Sighing
Mineto Belt Your Eye
Not with Coinsthough they be Minted
From an Emperors Hand
Be my lipsthe only Buckle
Your low Eyesdemand
Mine to staywhen all have wandered
To devise once more
If the Life be too surrendered
Life of Minerestore
Poured like thisMy Whole Libation
Just that You should see
Bliss of DeathLifes Bliss extol thro
Imitating You
Mineto guard Your Narrow Precinct
To seduce the Sun
Longest on Your South to linger
Largest Dews of Morn
To demand in Your low favor
Lest the Jealous Grass
Greener leanOr fonder cluster
Round some other face
Mine to supplicate Madonna
If Madonna be
Could behold so far a Creature
ChristomittedMe
Just to follow Your dear future
Neer so far behind
For My Heaven
Had I not been
Most enoughdenied
Proud of my broken heart since thou didst break it
Proud of the pain I did not feel till thee
Proud of my night since thou with moons dost shake it
Not to partake thy passion my humility
Thou canst not boast like Jesus drunken without companion
Was the strong cup of anguish brewed for the Nazarene
Thou canst not pierce tradition with the peerless puncture
See I usurped thy crucifix to honor mine

Severer Service of myself
Ihastened to demand
To fill the awful Vacuum
Your life had left behind
I worried Nature with my Wheels
When Hers had ceased to run
When she had put away Her Work
My own had just begun
I strove to weary Brain and Bone
To harass to fatigue
The glittering Retinue of nerves
Vitality to clog
To some dull comfort Those obtain
Who put a Head away
They knew the Hair to
And forget the color of the Day
Affliction would not be appeased
The Darkness braced as firm
As all my stratagem had been
The Midnight to confirm
No Drug for Consciousnesscan be
Alternative to die
Is Natures only Pharmacy
For Beings Malady
Sexton My Masters sleeping here
Pray lead me to his bed
I came to build the Birds nest
And sow the Early seed
That when the snow creeps slowly
From off his chamber door
Daisies point the way there
And the Troubadour
Shall I take thee the Poet said
To the propounded word
Be stationed with the Candidates
Till I have finer tried
The Poet searched Philology
And when about to ring
For the suspended Candidate
There came unsummoned in
That portion of the Vision
The Word applied to fill
Not unto nomination
The Cherubim reveal
She bore it till the simple veins
Traced azure on her hand
Til pleading round her quiet eyes
The purple Crayons stand
Till Daffodils had come and gone
I cannot tell the sum
And then she ceased to bear it
And with the Saints sat down
No more her patient figure
At twilight soft to meet
No more her timid bonnet
Upon the village street
But Crowns instead and Courtiers
And in the midst so fair
Whose but her shyimmortal face
Of whom were whispering here
She could not live upon the Past
The Present did not know her
And so she sought this sweet at last
And nature gently owned her
The mother that has not a knell
for either Duke or Robin
She dealt her pretty words like Blades
How glittering they shone
And every One unbared a Nerve
Or wantoned with a Bone
She never deemedshe hurt
Thatis not Steels Affair
A vulgar grimace in the Flesh
How ill the Creatures bear
To Ache is humannot polite
The Film upon the eye
Mortalitys old Custom
Just locking upto Die
She died at play
Gambolled away
Her lease of spotted hours
Then sank as gaily as a Turn
Upon a Couch of flowers
Her ghost strolled softly oer the hill
Yesterday and Today
Her vestments as the silver fleece
Her countenance as spray
She diedthis was the way she died
And when her breath was done
Took up her simple wardrobe
And started for the sun
Her little figure at the gate
The Angels must have spied
Since I could never find her
Upon the mortal side
She dwelleth in the Ground
Where Daffodilsabide
Her MakerHer Metropolis
The UniverseHer Maid
To fetch Her Graceand Hue
And Fairnessand Renown
The FirmamentsTo Pluck Her
And fetch Her Theebe mine
She hideth Her the last
And is the first to rise
Her Night doth hardly recompense
The Closing of Her eyes
She doth Her Purple Work
And putteth Her away
In low Apartments in the Sod
As worthily as We
To imitate her life
As impotent would be
As make of Our imperfect Mints
The Julepof the Bee
She lay as if at play
Her life had leaped away
Intending to return
But not so soon
Her merry Arms half dropt
As if for lull of sport
An instant had forgot
The Trick to start
Her dancing Eyesajar
As if their Owner were
Still sparkling through
For funat you
Her Morning at the door
Devising I am sure
To force her sleep
So lightso deep
She rose to His Requirementdropt
The Playthings of Her Life
To take the honorable Work
Of Woman and of Wife
If ought She missed in Her new Day
Of Amplitude or Awe
Or first ProspectiveOr the Gold
In using wear away
It lay unmentionedas the Sea
Develop Pearl and Weed
But only to Himselfbe known
The Fathoms they abide
Shes happy with a new Content
That feels to herlike Sacrament
Shes busywith an altered Care
As just apprenticed to the Air
Shes tearfulif she weep at all
For blissful CausesMost of all
That Heaven permit so meek as her
To such a Fateto Minister
She slept beneath a tree
Remembered but by me
I touched her Cradle mute
She recognized the foot
Put on her carmine suit
And see
She sped as Petals of a Rose
Offended by the Wind
A frail Aristocrat of Time
Indemnity to find
Leaving on naturea Default
As Cricket or as Bee
But Andes in the Bosoms where
She had begun to lie
She staked her FeathersGained an Arc
DebatedRose again
This timebeyond the estimate
Of Envy or of Men
And now among Circumference
Her steady Boat be seen
At homeamong the BillowsAs
The Bough where she was born
She sweeps with manycolored brooms
And leaves the shreds behind
Oh housewife in the evening west
Come back and dust the pond
You dropped a purple ravelling in
You dropped an amber thread
And now youve littered all the East
With duds of emerald
And still she plies her spotted brooms
And still the aprons fly
Till brooms fade softly into stars
And then I come away
She went as quiet as the Dew
From an Accustomed flower
Not like the Dew did she return
At the Accustomed hour
She dropt as softly as a star
From out my summers Eve
Less skillful than Le Verriere
Its sorer to believe
Shells from the Coast mistaking
I cherished them for All
Happening in After Ages
To entertain a Pearl
Wherefore so lateI murmured
My need of Theebe done
Thereforethe Pearl responded
My Period begin
Should you but fail atSea
In sight of me
Or doomed lie
Next Sunto die
Or rapat Paradiseunheard
Id harass God
Until he let you in
Sic transit gloria mundi
How doth the busy bee
Dum vivimus vivamus
I stay mine enemy
Oh veni vidi vici
Oh caput capapie
And oh memento mori
When I am far from thee
Hurrah for Peter Parley
Hurrah for Daniel Boone
Three cheers sir for the gentleman
Who first observed the moon
Peter put up the sunshine
Patti arrange the stars
Tell Luna tea is waiting
And call your brother Mars
Put down the apple Adam
And come away with me
So shalt thou have a pippin
From off my fathers tree
I climb the Hill of Science
I view the landscape oer
Such transcendental prospect
I neer beheld before
Unto the Legislature
My country bids me go
Ill take my india rubbers
In case the wind should blow
During my education
It was announced to me
That gravitation stumbling
Fell from an apple tree
The earth upon an axis
Was once supposed to turn
By way of a gymnastic
In honor of the sun
It was the brave Columbus
A sailing oer the tide
Who notified the nations
Of where I would reside
Mortality is fatal
Gentility is fine
Rascality heroic
Insolvency sublime
Our Fathers being weary
Laid down on Bunker Hill
And tho full many a morning
Yet they are sleeping still
The trumpet sir shall wake them
In dreams I see them rise
Each with a solemn musket
A marching to the skies
A coward will remain Sir
Until the fight is done
But an immortal hero
Will take his hat and run
Good bye Sir I am going
My country calleth me
Allow me Sir at parting
To wipe my weeping ee
In token of our friendship
Accept this Bonnie Doon
And when the hand that plucked it
Hath passed beyond the moon
The memory of my ashes
Will consolation be
Then farewell Tuscarora
And farewell Sir to thee
Silence is all we dread
Theres Ransom in a Voice
But Silence is Infinity
Himself have not a face
Size circumscribesit has no room
For petty furniture
The Giant tolerates no Gnat
For Ease of Gianture
Repudiates it all the more
Because intrinsic size
Ignores the possibility
Of Calumniesor Flies
Sleep is supposed to be
By souls of sanity
The shutting of the eye
Sleep is the station grand
Down which on either hand
The hosts of witness stand
Morn is supposed to be
By people of degree
The breaking of the Day
Morning has not occurred
That shall Aurora be
East of Eternity
One with the banner gay
One in the red array
That is the break of Day
Smiling back from Coronation
May be Luxury
On the Heads that started with us
Beings Peasantry
Recognizing in Procession
Ones We former knew
When Ourselves were also dusty
Centuries ago
Had the Triumph no Conviction
Of how many be
Stimulatedby the Contrast
Unto Misery
Snow beneath whose chilly softness
Some that never lay
Make their first Repose this Winter
I admonish Thee
Blanket Wealthier the Neighbor
We so new bestow
Than thine acclimated Creature
Wilt Thou Austere Snow
I counted till they danced so
Their slippers leaped the town
And then I took a pencil
To note the rebels down
And then they grew so jolly
I did resign the prig
And ten of my once stately toes
Are marshalled for a jig
So bashful when I spied her
So prettyso ashamed
So hidden in her leaflets
Lest anybody find
So breathless till I passed here
So helpless when I turned
And bore her struggling blushing
Her simple haunts beyond
For whom I robbed the Dingle
For whom I betrayed the Dell
Many will doubtless ask me
But I shall never tell
So from the mould
Scarlet and Gold
Many a Bulb will rise
Hidden away cunningly From sagacious eyes
So from Cocoon
Many a Worm
Leap so Highland gay
Peasants like me
Peasants like Thee
Gaze perplexedly
So glad we area Strangerd deem
Twas sorry that we were
For where the Holiday should be
There publishes a Tear
Nor how Ourselves be justified
Since Grief and Joy are done
So similarAn Optizan
Could not decide between
So has a Daisy vanished
From the fields today
So tiptoed many a slipper
To Paradise away
Oozed so in crimson bubbles
Days departing tide
Bloomingtrippingflow ing
Are ye then with God
So much of Heaven has gone from Earth
That there must be a Heaven
If only to enclose the Saints
To Affidavit given
The Missionary to the Mole
Must prove there is a Sky
Location doubtless he would plead
But what excuse have I
Too much of Proof affronts Belief
The Turtle will not try
Unless you leave him then return
And he has hauled away
So much Summer
Me for showing
Illegitimate
Would a Smiles minute bestowing
Too exorbitant
To the Lady
With the Guinea
Lookif She should know
Crumb of Mine
A Robins Larder
Would suffice to stow
So proud she was to die
It made us all ashamed
That what we cherished so unknown
To her desire seemed
So satisfied to go
Where none of us should be
Immediately that anguish stooped
Almost to jealousy
So set its Sun in Thee
What Day be dark to me
What Distancefar
So I the Ships may see
That touchhow seldomly
Thy Shore
So the Eyes accostand sunder
In an Audience
Stampedoccasionallyforever
So may Countenance
Entertainwithout addressing
Countenance of One
In a Neighboring Horizon
Goneas soon as known
So well that I can live without
I love theethen How well is that
As well as Jesus
Prove it me
That Heloved Men
As Ilove thee
Soil of Flint if steady tilled
Will refund by Hand
Seed of Palm by Libyan Sun
Fructified in Sand
Some Days retired from the rest
In soft distinction lie
The Day that a Companion came
Or was obliged to die
Some keep the Sabbath going to Church
I keep it staying at Home
With a Bobolink for a Chorister
And an Orchard for a Dome
Some keep the Sabbath in Surplice
I just wear my Wings
And instead of tolling the Bell for Church
Our little Sexton sings
God preaches a noted Clergyman
And the sermon is never long
So instead of getting to Heaven at least
Im going all along
Some Rainbowcoming from the Fair
Some Vision of the World Cashmere
I confidently see
Or else a Peacocks purple Train
Feather by featheron the plain
Fritters itself away
The dreamy Butterflies bestir
Lethargic pools resume the whir
Of last years sundered tune
From some old Fortress on the sun
Baronial Beesmarchone by one
In murmuring platoon
The Robins stand as thick today
As flakes of snow stood yesterday
On fenceand Roofand Twig
The Orchis binds her feather on
For her old lover Don the Sun
Revisiting the Bog
Without Commander Countless Still
The Regiments of Wood and Hill
In bright detachment stand
Behold Whose Multitudes are these
The children of whose turbaned seas
Or what Circassian Land
Some such Butterfly be seen
On Brazilian Pampas
Just at noonno laterSweet
Thenthe License closes
Some such Spiceexpress and pass
Subject to Your Plucking
As the StarsYou knew last Night
ForeignersThis Morning
Some things that fly there be
BirdsHoursthe Bumblebee
Of these no Elegy
Some things that stay there be
GriefHillsEternitymda sh
Nor this behooveth me
There are that resting rise
Can I expound the skies
How still the Riddle lies
Some too fragile for winter winds
The thoughtful grave encloses
Tenderly tucking them in from frost
Before their feet are cold
Never the treasures in her nest
The cautious grave exposes
Building where schoolboy dare not look
And sportsman is not bold
This covert have all the children
Early aged and often cold
Sparrow unnoticed by the Father
Lambs for whom time had not a fold
Sometimes with the Heart
Seldom with the Soul
Scarcer once with the Might
Few love at all
Soto Explore thyself
Therein thyself shalt find
The Undiscovered Continent
No Settler had the Mind
Soul Wilt thou toss again
By just such a hazard
Hundreds have lost indeed
But tens have won an all
Angels breathless ballot
Lingers to record thee
Imps in eager Caucus
Raffle for my Soul
South Winds jostle them
Bumblebees come
Hoverhesitate
Dri nk and are gone
Butterflies pause
On their passage Cashmere
Isoftly plucking
Present them here
Sown in dishonor
Ah Indeed
May this dishonor be
If I were half so fine myself
Id notice nobody
Sown in corruption
Not so fast
Apostle is askew
Corinthians 1 15 narrates
A Circumstance or two
Speechis a prank of Parliament
Tearsis a trick of the nerve
But the Heart with the heaviest freight on
Doesntalwaysmove
Speech is one symptom of Affection
And Silence one
The perfectest communication
Is heard of none
Exists and its indorsement
Is had within
Behold said the Apostle
Yet had not seen
Split the Larkand youll find the Music
Bulb after Bulb in Silver rolled
Scantilly dealt to the Summer Morning
Saved for your Ear when Lutes be old
Loose the Floodyou shall find it patent
Gush after Gush reserved for you
Scarlet Experiment Sceptic Thomas
Now do you doubt that your Bird was true
Spring comes on the World
I sight the Aprils
Hueless to me until thou come
As till the Bee
Blossoms stand negative
Touched to Conditions
By a Hum
Spring is the Period
Express from God
Among the other seasons
Himself abide
But during March and April
None stir abroad
Without a cordial interview
With God
STEP lightly on this narrow spot
The broadest land that grows
Is not so ample as the breast
These emerald seams enclose

Step lofty for this name is told
As far as cannon dwell
Or flag subsist or fame export
Her deathless syllable
Strong Draughts of Their Refreshing Minds
To drinkenables Mine
Through Desert or the Wilderness
As bore it Sealed Wine
To go elasticOr as One
The Camels traitattained
How powerful the Stimulus
Of an Hermetic Mind
Struck was I not yet by Lightning
Lightninglets away
Power to perceive His Process
With Vitality
Maimedwas Iyet not by Venture
Stone of stolid Boy
Nor a Sportsmans Peradventure
Who mine Enemy
Robbedwas Iintact to Bandit
All my Mansion torn
Sunwithdrawn to Recognition
Furthest shiningdone
Yet was not the foeof any
Not the smallest Bird
In the nearest Orchard dwelling
Be of Meafraid
MostI love the Cause that slew Me
Often as I die
Its beloved Recognition
Holds a Sun on Me
Bestat Settingas is Natures
Neither witnessed Rise
Till the infinite Aurora
In the others eyes
Success is counted sweetest
By those who neer succeed
To comprehend a nectar
Requires sorest need
Not one of all the purple Host
Who took the Flag today
Can tell the definition
So clear of Victory
As he defeateddying
On whose forbidden ear
The distant strains of triumph
Burst agonized and clear
Such is the Force of Happiness
The Leastcan lift a Ton
Assisted by its stimulus
Who Miserysustain
No Sinew can afford
The Cargo of Themselves
Too infinite for Consciousness
Slow capabilities
Summer for thee grant I may be
When Summer days are flown
Thy music still when Whipporwill
And Orioleare done
For thee to bloom Ill skip the tomb
And row my blossoms oer
Pray gather me
Anemone
Thy flowerforevermore
A drop fell on the apple tree
Another on the roof
A half a dozen kissed the eaves
And made the gables laugh
A few went out to help the brook
That went to help the sea
Myself conjectured Were they pearls
What necklaces could be
The dust replaced in hoisted roads
The birds jocoser sung
The sunshine threw his hat away
The orchards spangles hung
The breezes brought dejected lutes
And bathed them in the glee
The East put out a single flag
And signed the fete away
Sunset at Nightis natural
But Sunset on the Dawn
Reverses NatureMaster
So Midnightsdueat Noon
Eclipses bepredicted
And Science bows them in
But do one face us suddenly
Jehovahs Watchis wrong
Superfluous were the Sun
When Excellence be dead
He were superfluous every Day
For every Day be said
That syllable whose Faith
Just saves it from Despair
And whose Ill meet You hesitates
If Love inquire Where
Upon His dateless Fame
Our Periods may lie
As Stars that drop anonymous
From an abundant sky
Surgeons must be very careful
When they take the knife
Underneath their fine incisions
Stirs the CulpritLife
Suspenseis Hostiler than Death
Deaththosoever Broad
Is Just Death and cannot increase
Suspensedoes not conclude
But perishesto live anew
But just anew to die

T was just this time last year I died
I know I heard the corn
When I was carried by the farms
It had the tassels on
I thought how yellow it would look
When Richard went to mill
And then I wanted to get out
But something held my will
I thought just how red apples wedged
The stubbles joints between
And carts went stooping round the fields
To take the pumpkins in
I wondered which would miss me least
And when Thanksgiving came
If fatherd multiply the plates
To make an even sum
And if my stocking hung too high
Would it blur the Christmas glee
That not a Santa Claus could reach
The altitude of me
But this sort grieved myself and so
I thought how it would be
When just this time some perfect year
Themselves should come to me
Take your Heaven further on
Thisto Heaven divine Has gone
Had You earlier blundered in
Possibly een You had seen
An Eternityput on
Nowto ring a Door beyond
Is the utmost of Your Hand
To the Skiesapologize
Nearer to Your Courtesies
Than this Sufferer polite
Dressed to meet You
Seein White
Taking up the fair Ideal
Just to cast her down
When a fracturewe discover
Or a splintered Crown
Makes the Heavens portable
And the Godsa lie
DoubtlessAdammd ashscowled at Eden
For his perjury
Cherishingour pool Ideal
Till in purer dress
We behold herglorified

Till the broken creatures
We adoredfor whole
Stainsall washed

Meet uswith a smile
Talk with prudence to a Beggar
Of Potose and the mines
Reverently to the Hungry
Of your viands and your wines
Cautious hint to any Captive
You have passed enfranchised feet
Anecdotes of air in Dungeons
Have sometimes proved deadly sweet
Teach HimWhen He makes the names
Such an oneto say
On his babblingBerrylips
As should soundto me
Were my Earas near his nest
As my thoughttoday
As should sound
Forbid us not
Some like Emily
Tell all the truth but tell it slant
Success in circuit lies
Too bright for our infirm delight
The truths superb surprise
As lightning to the children eased
With explanation kind
The truth must dazzle gradually
Or every man be blind
Tell as a Marksman were forgotten
Tell this Day endures
Ruddy as that coeval Apple
The Tradition bears
Fresh as Mankind that humble story
Though a statelier Tale
Grown in the Repetition hoary
Scarcely would prevail
Tell had a son The ones that knew it
Need not linger here
Those who did not to Human Nature
Will subscribe a Tear
Tell would not bare his Head
In Presence
Of the Ducal Hat
Threatened for that with Death by Gessler
Tyranny bethought
Make of his only Boy a Target
That surpasses Death
Stolid to Loves supreme entreaty
Not forsook of Faith
Mercy of the Almighty begging
Tell his Arrow sent
God it is said replies in Person
When the cry is meant
That after Horrorthat twas us
That passed the mouldering Pier
Just as the Granite Crumb let go
Our Savior by a Hair
A second more had dropped too deep
For Fisherman to plumb
The very profile of the Thought
Puts Recollection numb
The possibilityto pass
Without a Moments Bell
Into Conjectures presence
Is like a Face of Steel
That suddenly looks into ours
With a metallic grin
The Cordiality of Death
Who drills his Welcome in
That Distance was between Us
That is not of Mile or Main
The Will it is that situates
Equatornever can
That first Day when you praised Me Sweet
And said that I was strong
And could be mighty if I liked
That Daythe Days among
Glows Centrallike a Jewel
Between Diverging Golds
The Minor Onethat gleamed behind
And Vasterof the Worlds
That I did always love
I bring thee Proof
That till I loved
I never livedEnough
That I shall love alway
I argue thee
That love is life
And life hath Immortality
Thisdost thou doubtSweet
Then have I
Nothing to show
But Calvary
That is solemn we have ended
Be it but a Play
Or a Glee among the Garret
Or a Holiday
Or a leaving Home or later
Parting with a World
We have understood for better
Still to be explained
The Admirationsand Contemptsof time
Show justestthrough an Open Tomb
The Dyingas it were a Height

The Angle of a Landscape
That every time I wake
Between my Curtain and the Wall
Upon an ample Crack
Like a Venetianwaiting
Accosts my open eye

Held slanting in the Sky
The Pattern of a Chimney

THE BAT is dun with wrinkled wings
Like fallow article
And not a song pervades his lips
Or none perceptible

His small umbrella quaintly halved
Describing in the air
An arc alike inscrutable
Elate philosopher

Deputed from what firmament
Of what astute abode
Empowered with what malevolence
Auspiciously withheld

To his adroit Creator
Ascribe no less the praise
Beneficent believe me
His eccentricities
The Battle fought between the Soul
And No Manis the One
Of all the Battles prevalent
By far the Greater One

They dropped like flakes they dropped like stars
Like petals from a rose
When suddenly across the June
A wind with fingers goes
They perished in the seamless grass
No eye could find the place
But God on his repealless list
Can summon every face
The Bee is not afraid of me
I know the Butterfly
The pretty people in the Woods
Receive me cordially
The Brooks laugh louder when I come
The Breezes madder play
Wherefore mine eye thy silver mists

The Beggar at the Door for Fame

But Bread is that Diviner thing
Disclosed to be denied
The Beggar Laddies early

The Birds begun at Four oclock
Their period for Dawn
A Music numerous as space
But neighboring as Noon
I could not count their Force
Their Voices did expend
As Brook by Brook bestows itself
To multiply the Pond
Their Witnesses were not
Except occasional man
In homely industry arrayed
To overtake the Morn
Nor was it for applause
That I could ascertain
But independent Ecstasy
Of Deity and Men
By Six the Flood had done
No Tumult there had been
Of Dressing or Departure
And yet the Band was gone
The Sun engrossed the East
The Day controlled the World

Forgotten as fulfilled

A Wiser Sympathy
The Black Berrywears a Thorn in his side
But no Man heard Him cry
He offers His Berry just the same
To Partridgeand to Boy
He sometimes holds upon the Fence
Or struggles to a Tree
Or clasps a Rock with both His Hands
But not for Sympathy
Wetell a Hurtto cool it

Brave Black Berry
No brigadier throughout the year
So civic as the jay
A neighbor and a warrior too
With shrill felicity
Pursuing winds that censure us
A February day
The brother of the universe
Was never blown away
The snow and he are intimate
I ve often seen them play
When heaven looked upon us all
With such severity
I felt apology were due
To an insulted sky
Whose pompous frown was nutriment
To their temerity
The pillow of this daring head
Is pungent evergreens
His larder terse and militant
Unknown refreshing things
His character a tonic
His future a dispute
Unfair an immortality
That leaves this neighbor out
The Body grows without
The more convenient way
That if the Spiritlike to hide

The bustle in a house
The morning after death
Is solemnest of industries
Enacted upon earth
The sweeping up the heart
And putting love away
We shall not want to use again
Until eternity

The Butterfly in honored Dust
Assuredly will lie
But none will pass the Catacomb
So chastened as the Fly
The butterfly obtains
But little sympathy
Though favorably mentioned
In Entomology
Because he travels freely
And wears a proper coat
The circumspect are certain
That he is dissolute
Had he the homely scutcheon
Of modest Industry
Twere fitter certifying
For Immortality
The Butterflys Assumption Gown
In Chrysoprase Apartments hung
This afternoon put on
How condescending to descend
And be of Buttercups the friend
In a New England Town
The Butterfly upon the Sky
That doesnt know its Name
And hasnt any tax to pay
And hasnt any Home
Is just as high as you and I
And higher I believe
So soar away and never sigh
And thats the way to grieve
Because I could not stop for Death
He kindly stopped for me
The carriage held but just ourselves
And Immortality
We slowly drove he knew no haste
And I had put away
My labor and my leisure too
For his civility
We passed the school where children played
Their lessons scarcely done
We passed the fields of gazing grain
We passed the setting sun
We paused before a house that seemed
A swelling of the ground
The roof was scarcely visible
The cornice but a mound
Since then tis centuries but each
Feels shorter than the day
I first surmised the horses heads
Were toward eternity
The Chemical conviction
That Nought be lost
Enable in Disaster
My fractured Trust
The Faces of the Atoms
If I shall see
How more the Finished Creatures
Departed me
The Childs faith is new
Wholelike His Principle
Widelike the Sunrise
On fresh Eyes
Never had a Doubt
Laughsat a Scruple
Believes all sham
But Paradise
Credits the World
Deems His Dominion
Broadest of Sovereignties
And Caesarmean
In the Comparison
Baseless Emperor
Ruler of Nought
Yet swaying all
Grown bye and bye
To hold mistaken
His pretty estimates
Of Prickly Things
He gains the skill
Sorrowfulas certain
Mento anticipate
Instead of Kings
The Clovers simple Fame
Remembered of the Cow
Is better than enameled Realms
Of notability
Renown perceives itself
And that degrades the Flower
The Daisy that has looked behind
Has compromised its power
The Color of a Queen is this
The Color of a Sun
At settingthis and Amber
Beryland this at Noon
And when at nightAuroran widths
Fling suddenly on men

The Color of the Grave is Green
The Outer GraveI mean
You would not know it from the Field
Except it own a Stone
To help the fondto find it
Too infinite asleep
To stop and tell them where it is
But just a Daisydeep
The Color of the Grave is white
The outer GraveI mean
You would not know it from the Drifts
In Wintertill the Sun
Has furrowed out the Aisles
Thenhigher than the Land
The little Dwelling Houses rise
Where eachhas left a friend
The Color of the Grave within
The DuplicateI mean
Not all the Snows could make it white
Not all the SummersGreen
Youve seen the Colormaybe
Upon a Bonnet bound
When that you met it with before

To gain his graceId die
Ill seek his royal feet
Ill sayRememberKing
Thou shaltthyselfone daya Child
Implore a largerthing
That Empireis of Czars
As smallthey sayas I
Grant methat daythe royalty
To intercedefor Thee
The cricket sang
And set the sun
And workmen finished one by one
Their seam the day upon
The low grass loaded with the dew
The twilight stood as strangers do
With hat in hand polite and new
To stay as if or go
A vastness as a neighbor came
A wisdom without face or name
A peace as hemispheres at home
And so the night became
The Daisy follows soft the Sun
And when his golden walk is done
Sits shyly at his feet
Hewakingfinds the flower there
WhereforeMarauderart thou here
Because Sir love is sweet
We are the FlowerThou the Sun
Forgive us if as days decline
We nearer steal to Thee
Enamored of the parting West
The peacethe flightthe Amethyst
Nights possibility
The day came slow till five oclock
Then sprang before the hills
Like hindered rubies or the light
A sudden musket spills
The purple could not keep the east
The sunrise shook from fold
Like breadths of topaz packed a night
The lady just unrolled
The happy winds their timbrels took
The birds in docile rows
Arranged themselves around their prince
The wind is prince of those
The orchard sparkled like a Jew
How mighty twas to stay
A guest in this stupendous place
The parlor of the day
The Day that I was crowned
Was like the other Days
Until the Coronation came
And thentwas Otherwise
As Carbon in the Coal
And Carbon in the Gem
Are Oneand yet the former
Were dull for Diadem
I rose and all was plain
But when the Day declined
Myself and It in Majesty
Were equallyadorned
The Grace that Iwas chose
To Mesurpassed the Crown
That was the Witness for the Grace
Twas even that twas Mine
The Day undressedHerself
Her Garterwas of Gold
Her Petticoatof Purple plain
Her Dimitiesas old
Exactlyas the World
And yet the newest Star
Enrolled upon the Hemisphere
Be wrinkledmuch as Her
Too near to Godto pray
Too near to Heavento fear
The Lady of the Occident
Retired without a care
Her Candle so expire
The flickering be seen
On Ball of Mast in Bosporus
And Domeand Window Pane
The Definition of Beauty is
That Definition is none
Of Heaven easing Analysis
Since Heaven and He are one
The Devil had he fidelity
Would be the best friend
Because he has ability
But Devils cannot mend
Perfidy is the virtue
That would but he resign
The Devil without question
Were thoroughly divine
The difference between Despair
And Fearis like the One
Between the instant of a Wreck
And when the Wreck has been
The Mind is smoothno Motion
Contented as the Eye
Upon the Forehead of a Bust
That knowsit cannot see
The Doomedregard the Sunrise
With different Delight
Becausewhen next it burns abroad
They doubt to witness it
The Manto dietomorrow
Harks for the Meadow Bird
Because its Music stirs the Axe
That clamors for his head
Joyfulto whom the Sunrise
Precedes EnamoredDay
Joyfulfor whom the Meadow Bird
Has ought but Elegy
The Drop that wrestles in the Sea
Forgets her own locality
As Itoward Thee
She knows herself an incense small
Yet smallshe sighsif Allis All
How largerbe
The Oceansmilesat her Conceit
But she forgetting Amphitrite
PleadsMe
The Dust behind I strove to join
Unto the Disk before
But Sequence ravelled out of Sound
Like Balls upon a Floor
The duties of the Wind are few
To cast the ships at Sea
Establish March the Floods escort
And usher Liberty
The pleasures of the Wind are broad
To dwell Extent among
Remain or wander
Speculate or Forests entertain
The kinsmen of the Wind are Peaks
Azof the Equinox
Also with Bird and Asteroid
A bowing intercourse
The limitations of the Wind
Do he exist or die
Too wise he seems for Wakelessness
However know not i
The dying need but little dear
A glass of waters all
A flowers unobtrusive face
To punctuate the wall
A fan perhaps a friends regret
And certainly that one
No color in the rainbow
Perceives when you are gone
The earth has many keys
Where melody is not
Is the unknown peninsula
Beauty is natures fact
But witness for her land
And witness for her sea
The cricket is her utmost
Of elegy to me
The face I carry with melast
When I go out of Time
To take my Rankbyin the West
That facewill just be thine
Ill hand it to the Angel
ThatSirwas my Degree
In Kingdomsyou have heard the Raised
Refer topossibly
Hell take itscan itstep aside
Returnwith such a crown
As Gabrielnever capered at
And beg me put it on
And thenhell turn me round and round
To an admiring sky
As one that bore her Masters name
Sufficient Royalty
The Face we choose to miss
Be it but for a Day
As absent as a Hundred Years
When it has rode away
The feet of people walking home
With gayer sandals go
The Crocus til she rises
The Vassal of the snow
The lips at Hallelujah
Long years of practise bore
Til bye and bye these Bargemen
Walked singing on the shore
Pearls are the Divers farthings
Extorted from the Sea
Pinions the Seraphs wagon
Pedestrian once as we
Night is the mornings Canvas
Larceny legacy
Death but our rapt attention
To Immortality
My figures fail to tell me
How far the Village lies
Whose peasants are the Angels
Whose Cantons dot the skies
My Classics veil their faces
My faith that Dark adores
Which from its solemn abbeys
Such ressurection pours
The Fingers of the Light
Tapped soft upon the Town
With I am great and cannot wait
So therefore let me in
Youre soon the Town replied
My Faces are asleep
But swear and I will let you by
You will not wake them up
The easy Guest complied
But once within the Town
The transport of His Countenance
Awakened Maid and Man
The Neighbor in the Pool
Upon His Hip elate
Made loud obeisance and the Gnat
Held up His Cup for Light
The first Days Night had come
And grateful that a thing
So terriblehad been endured
I told my Soul to sing
She said her Strings were snapt
Her Bowto Atoms blown
And so to mend hergave me work
Until another Morn
And thena Day as huge
As Yesterdays in pairs
Unrolled its horror in my face
Until it blocked my eyes
My Brainbegun to laugh
I mumbledlike a fool
And tho tis Years agothat Day
My Brain keeps gigglingstill
And Somethings oddwithin
That person that I was
And this Onedo not feel the same
Could it be Madnessthis
The first Day that I was a Life
I recollect itHow still
That last Day that I was a Life
I recollect itas well
Twas stillerthough the first
Was still
Twas emptybut the first
Was full
Thiswas my finallest Occasion
But then
My tenderer Experiment
Toward Men
Which choose I
ThatI cannot say
Which choose They
Question Memory
The Flower must not blame the Bee
That seeketh his felicity
Too often at her door
But teach the Footman from Vevay
Mistress is not at hometo say
To peopleany more
The Futurenever spoke
Nor will Helike the Dumb
Reveal by signa syllable
Of His Profound To Come
But when the News be ripe
Presents itin the Act
Forestalling Preparation
Escapeor Substitute
Indifference to Him
The Doweras the Doom
His Officebut to execute
FatesTelegramto Him
The Gentian weaves her fringes
The Maples loom is red
My departing blossoms
Obviate parade
A brief but patient illness
An hour to prepare
And one below this morning
Is where the angels are
It was a short procession
The Bobolink was there
An aged Bee addressed us
And then we knelt in prayer
We trust that she was willing
We ask that we may be
SummerSisterSeraph
Let us go with thee
In the name of the Bee
And of the Butterfly
And of the BreezeAmen
The going from a world we know
To one a wonder still
Is like the childs adversity
Whose vista is a hill
Behind the hill is sorcery
And everything unknown
But will the secret compensate
For climbing it alone
The good Will of a Flower
The Man who would possess
Must first present
Certificate
Of minted Holiness
The GraceMyselfmight not obtain
Confer upon My flower
Refracted but a Countenance
For Iinhabit Her
The Grass so little has to do –
A Sphere of simple Green –
With only Butterflies to brood
And Bees to entertain –
And stir all day to pretty Tunes
The Breezes fetch along –
And hold the Sunshine in its lap
And bow to everything –
And thread the Dews all night like Pearls –
And make itself so fine
A Duchess were too common
For such a noticing –
And even when it dies – to pass
In Odors so divine –
Like Lowly spices lain to sleep –
Or Spikenards perishing –
And then in Sovereign Barns to dwell –
And dream the Days away
The Grass so little has to do
I wish I were a Hay –
The grave my little cottage is
Where Keeping house for thee
I make my parlor orderly
And lay the marble tea
For two divided briefly
A cycle it may be
Till everlasting life unite
In strong society
The Guest is gold and crimson
An Opal guest and gray
Of Ermine is his doublet
His Capuchin gay
He reaches town at nightfall
He stops at every door
Who looks for him at morning
I pray him tooexplore
The Larks pure territory
Or the Lapwings shore
The hallowing of Pain
Like hallowing of Heaven
Obtains at a corporeal cost
The Summit is not given
To Him who strives severe
At middle of the Hill
But He who has achieved the Top
Allis the price of All
The heart asks pleasure first
And then excuse from pain
And then those little anodynes
That deaden suffering
And then to go to sleep
And then if it should be
The will of its Inquisitor
The liberty to die
The Heart has narrow Banks
It measures like the Sea
In mightyunremitting Bass
And Blue Monotony
Till Hurricane bisect
And as itself discerns
Its sufficient Area
The Heart convulsive learns
That Calm is but a Wall
Of unattempted Gauze
An instants Push demolishes
A Questioningdissolves
The Heaven vests for Each
In that small Deity
It craved the grace to worship
Some bashful Summers Day
Half shrinking from the Glory
It importuned to see
Till these faint Tabernacles drop
In full Eternity
How imminent the Venture
As one should sue a Star
For His mean sake to leave the Row
And entertain Despair
A Clemency so common
We almost cease to fear
Enabling the minutest
And furthestto adore
The Hills erect their Purple Heads
The Rivers lean to see
Yet Man has not of all the Throng
A Curiosity
The Hills in Purple syllables
The Days Adventures tell
To little Groups of Continents
Just going Home from School
The Himmaleh was known to stoop
Unto the Daisy low
Transported with Compassion
That such a Doll should grow
Where Tent by TentHer Universe
Hung out its Flags of Snow
The Hollows round His eager Eyes
Were Pages where to read
Pathetic Historiesalthough
Himself had not complained
Biography to All who passed
Of Unobtrusive Pain
Except for the italic Face
Endured unhelpedunknown
The inundation of the Spring
Enlarges every soul
It sweeps the tenement away
But leaves the Water whole
In which the soul at first estranged
Seeks faintly for its shore
But acclimated pines no more
For that Peninsula
The Judge is like the Owl
Ive heard my Father tell
And Owls do build in Oaks
So heres an Amber Sill
That slanted in my Path
When going to the Barn
And if it serve You for a House
Itself is not in vain
About the pricetis small
I only ask a Tune
At MidnightLet the Owl select
His favorite Refrain
The Jugglers Hat her Country is
The Mountain Gorsethe Bees
The Lady feeds Her little Bird
At rarer intervals
The little Bird would not dissent
But meekly recognize
The Gulf between the Hand and Her
And crumbless and afar
And fainting on Her yellow Knee
Fall softly and adore
The Lamp burns surewithin
Tho Serfssupply the Oil
It matters not the busy Wick
At her phosphoric toil
The Slaveforgetsto fill
The Lampburns goldenon
Unconscious that the oil is out
As that the Slaveis gone
The last Night that She lived
It was a Common Night
Except the Dyingthis to Us
Made Nature different
We noticed smallest things
Things overlooked before
By this great light upon our Minds
Italicizedas twere
As We went out and in
Between Her final Room
And Rooms where Those to be alive
Tomorrow were a Blame
That Others could exist
While She must finish quite
A Jealousy for Her arose
So nearly infinite
We waited while She passed
It was a narrow time
Too jostled were Our Souls to speak
At length the notice came
She mentioned and forgot
Then lightly as a Reed
Bent to the Water struggled scarce
Consented and was dead
And WeWe placed the Hair
And drew the Head erect
And then an awful leisure was
Belief to regulate
The Leaves like Women interchange
Exclusive Confidence
Somewhat of nods and somewhat
Portentous inference
The Parties in both cases
Enjoining secrecy
Inviolable compact
To notoriety
The Loneliness One dare not sound
And would as soon surmise
As in its Grave go plumbing
To ascertain the size
The Loneliness whose worst alarm
Is lest itself should see
And perish from before itself
For just a scrutiny
The Horror not to be surveyed
But skirted in the Dark
With Consciousness suspended
And Being under Lock
I fear me thisis Loneliness
The Maker of the soul
Its Caverns and its Corridors
Illuminateor seal
The lonesome for they know not What
The Eastern Exilesbe
Who strayed beyond the Amber line
Some madder Holiday
And ever sincethe purple Moat
They strive to climbin vain
As Birdsthat tumble from the clouds
Do fumble at the strain
The Blessed Ethertaught them
Some Transatlantic Morn
When Heavenwas too commonto miss
Too sureto dote upon
The Love a Life can show Below
Is but a filament I know
Of that diviner thing
That faints upon the face of Noon
And smites the Tinder in the Sun
And hinders Gabriels Wing
Tis thisin Musichints and sways
And far abroad on Summer days
Distils uncertain pain
Tis this enamors in the East
And tints the Transit in the West
With harrowing Iodine

The Luxury to apprehend
The Luxury twould be
To look at Thee a single time
An Epicure of Me
In whatsoever Presence makes
Till for a further Food
I scarcely recollect to starve
So first am I supplied
The Luxury to meditate
The Luxury it was
To banguet on thy Countenance
A Sumptuousness bestows
On plainer Days whose Table far
As Certainty can see
Is laden with a single Crumb

Alike to HimOne
The Manner of its Death
When Certain it must die
Tis deemed a privilege to choose
Twas Major Andres Way
When Choice of Lifeis past
There yet remains a Love
Its little Fate to stipulate
How small in those who live
The Miracle to tease
With Bable of the styles
How they are Dying mostlynow
And Customs at St James
The Martyr Poetsdid not tell
But wrought their Pang in syllable
That when their mortal name be numb
Their mortal fateencourage Some
The Martyr Paintersnever spoke
Bequeathingratherto their Work
That when their conscious fingers cease
Some seek in Artthe Art of Peace
The Missing Allprevented Me
From missing minor Things
If nothing larger than a Worlds
Departure from a Hinge
Or Suns extinction be observed
Twas not so large that I
Could lift my Forehead from my work
For Curiosity
The Months have endsthe Yearsa knot
No Power can untie
To stretch a little further
A Skein of Misery
The Earth lays back these tired lives
In her mysterious Drawers
Too tenderly that any doubt
An ultimate Repose
The manner of the Children
Who weary of the Day
Themselfthe noisy Plaything
They cannot put away
The Moon was but a Chin of Gold
A Night or two ago
And now she turns Her perfect Face
Upon the World below
Her Forehead is of Amplest Blonde
Her Cheeka Beryl hewn
Her Eye unto the Summer Dew
The likest I have known
Her Lips of Amber never part
But what must be the smile
Upon Her Friend she could confer
Were such Her Silver Will
And what a privilege to be
But the remotest Star
For Certainty She take Her Way
Beside Your Palace Door
Her Bonnet is the Firmament
The UniverseHer Shoe
The Starsthe Trinkets at Her Belt
Her Dimitiesof Blue
The Morning after Woe
Tis frequently the Way
Surpasses all that rose before
For utter Jubilee
As Nature did not care
And piled her Blossoms on
And further to parade a Joy
Her Victim stared upon
The Birds declaim their Tunes
Pronouncing every word
Like HammersDid they know they fell
Like Litanies of Lead
On here and therea creature
Theyd modify the Glee
To fit some Crucifixal Clef
Some Key of Calvary
The morns are meeker than they were
The nuts are getting brown
The berrys cheek is plumper
The Rose is out of town
The Maple wears a gayer scarf
The field a scarlet gown
Lest I should be old fashioned
Ill put a trinket on
The Mountain sat upon the Plain
In his tremendous Chair
His observation omnifold
His inquest everywhere
The Seasons played around his knees
Like Children round a sire
Grandfather of the Days is He
Of Dawn the Ancestor
The Mountainsgrow unnoticed
Their Purple figures rise
Without attemptExhaustion
Assistanceor Applause
In Their Eternal Faces
The Sunwith just delight
Looks longand lastand golden
For fellowshipat night
The Murmur of a Bee
A Witchcraftyieldeth me
If any ask me why
Twere easier to die
Than tell
The Red upon the Hill
Taketh away my will
If anybody sneer
Take carefor God is here
Thats all
The Breaking of the Day
Addeth to my Degree
If any ask me how
Artistwho drew me so
Must tell
The Mushroom is the Elf of Plants
At Evening it is not
At Morning in a Truffled Hut
It stop opon a Spot
As if it tarried always
And yet its whole Career
Is shorter than a Snakes Delay
And fleeter than a Tare
Tis Vegetations Juggler
The Germ of Alibi
Doth like a Bubble antedate
And like a Bubble hie
I feel as if the Grass was pleased
To have it intermit
This surreptitious Scion
Of Summers circumspect
Had Nature any supple Face
Or could she one contemn
Had Nature an Apostate
That Mushroom it is Him
Pain has an element of blank
It cannot recollect
When it began or if there were
A day when it was not
It has no future but itself
Its infinite realms contain
Its past enlightened to perceive
New periods of pain
The nameof itis Autumn
The hueof itis Blood
An Arteryupon the Hill
A Veinalong the Road
Great Globulesin the Alleys
And Oh the Shower of Stain
When Windsupset the Basin
And spill the Scarlet Rain
It sprinkles Bonnetsfar below
It gathers ruddy Pools
Theneddies like a Roseaway
Upon Vermilion Wheels
The nearest dream recedes unrealized
The heaven we chase
Like the June bee
Before the schoolboy
Invites the race
Stoops to an easy clover
Dipsevadesteasesdeploys
Then to the royal clouds
Lifts his light pinnace
Heedless of the boy
Staring bewildered at the mocking sky
Homesick for steadfast honey
Ah the bee flies not
That brews that rare variety
The Night was wide and furnished scant
With but a single Star
That often as a Cloud it met
Blew out itselffor fear
The Wind pursued the little Bush
And drove away the Leaves
November leftthen clambered up
And fretted in the Eaves
No Squirrel went abroad
A Dogs belated feet
Like intermittent Plush he heard
Adown the empty Street
To feel if Blinds be fast
And closer to the fire
Her little Rocking Chair to draw
And shiver for the Poor
The Housewifes gentle Task
How pleasantersaid she
Unto the Sofa opposite
The Sleetthan May no Thee
The Notice that is called the Spring
Is but a month from here
Put up my Heart thy Hoary work
And take a Rosy Chair
Not any House the Flowers keep
The Birds enamor Care
Our salary the longest Day
Is nothing but a Bier
The One who could repeat the Summer day
Were greater than itselfthough He
Minutest of Mankind should be
And Hecould reproduce the Sun
At period of going down
The Lingeringand the StainI mean
When Orient have been outgrown
And Occidentbecome Unknown
His Nameremain
The only ghost I ever saw
Was dressed in mechlin so
He wore no sandal on his foot
And stepped like flakes of snow
His gait was soundless like the bird
But rapid like the roe
His fashions quaint mosaic
Or haply mistletoe
Hi conversation seldom
His laughter like the breeze
That dies away in dimples
Among the pensive trees
Our interview was transient
Of me himself was shy
And God forbid I look behind
Since that appalling day
The Only News I know
Is Bulletins all Day
From Immortality
The Only Shows I see
Tomorrow and Today
Perchance Eternity
The Only One I meet
Is GodThe Only Street
ExistenceThis traversed
If Other News there be
Or Admirable Show
Ill tell it You
The Outerfrom the Inner
Derives its Magnitude
Tis Duke or Dwarf according
As is the Central Mood
The fineunvarying Axis
That regulates the Wheel
Though Spokesspinmore conspicuous
And fling a dustthe while
The Innerpaints the Outer
The Brush without the Hand
Its Picture publishesprecise
As is the inner Brand
On fineArterial Canvas
A Cheekperchance a Brow
The Stars whole Secretin the Lake
Eyes were not meant to know
The pedigree of honey
Does not concern the bee
A clover any time to him
Is aristocracy
The Poets light but Lamps
Themselvesgo out
The Wicks they stimulate
If vital Light
Inhere as do the Suns
Each Age a Lens
Disseminating their
Circumference
The power to be true to You
Until upon my face
The Judgment push his Picture
Presumptuous of Your Place
Of ThisCould Man deprive Me
Himselfthe Heaven excel
Whose invitationYours reduced
Until it showed too small
The Province of the Saved
Should be the ArtTo save
Through Skill obtained in Themselves
The Science of the Grave
No Man can understand
But He that hath endured
The Dissolutionin Himself
That Manbe qualified
To qualify Despair
To Those who failing new
Mistake Defeat for DeathEach time
Till acclimatedto
I like to see it lap the miles
And lick the valleys up
And stop to feed itself at tanks
And then prodigious step
Around a pile of mountains
And supercilious peer
In shanties by the sides of roads
And then a quarry pare
To fit its sides and crawl between
Complaining all the while
In horrid hooting stanza
Then chase itself down the hill
And neigh like Boanerges
Then punctual as a star
Stop docile and omnipotent
At its own stable door
The rainbow never tells me
That gust and storm are by
Yet is she more convincing
Than Philosophy
My flowers turn from Forums
Yet eloquent declare
What Cato couldnt prove me
Except the birds were here
The RedBlazeis the Morning
The Violetis Noon
The YellowDayis falling
And after thatis none
But Miles of Sparksat Evening
Reveal the Width that burned
The Territory Argentthat
Never yetconsumed
The reticent volcano keeps
His never slumbering plan
Confided are his projects pink
To no precarious man
If nature will not tell the tale
Jehovah told to her
Can human nature not survive
Without a listener
Admonished by her buckled lips
Let every babbler be
The only secret people keep
Is Immortality
The Road was lit with Moon and star
The Trees were bright and still
Descried I by the distant Light
A Traveller on a Hill
To magic Perpendiculars
Ascending though Terrene
Unknown his shimmering ultimate
But he indorsed the sheen
The Robin for the Crumb
Returns no syllable
But long records the Ladys name
In Silver Chronicle
The Robin is the One
That interrupt the Morn
With hurriedfewexpress Reports
When March is scarcely on
The Robin is the One
That overflow the Noon
With her cherubic quantity
An April but begun
The Robin is the One
That speechless from her Nest
Submit that Homeand Certainty
And Sanctity are best
The Robins my Criterion for Tune
Because I growwhere Robins do
But were I Cuckoo born
Id swear by him
The ode familiarrules the Noon
The Buttercups my Whim for Bloom
Because were Orchard sprung
But were I Britain born
Id Daisies spurn
None but the NutOctober fit
Because through dropping it
The Seasons flitIm taught
Without the Snows Tableau
Winter were lieto me
Because I seeNew Englandly
The Queen discerns like me
Provincially
The Rose did caper on her cheek
Her Bodice rose and fell
Her pretty speechlike drunken men
Did stagger pitiful
Her fingers fumbled at her work
Her needle would not go
What ailed so smart a little Maid
It puzzled me to know
Till oppositeI spied a cheek
That bore another Rose
Just oppositeAnother speech
That like the Drunkard goes
A Vest that like her Bodice danced
To the immortal tune
Till those two troubledlittle Clocks
Ticked softly into one
The Savior must have been
A docile Gentleman
To come so far so cold a Day
For little Fellowmen
The Road to Bethlehem
Since He and I were Boys
Was leveled but for that ‘twould be
A rugged Billion Miles
The Sea said Come to the Brook
The Brook said Let me grow
The Sea said Then you will be a Sea
I want a Brook Come now
The Sea said Go to the Sea
The Sea said I am he
You cherished Learned Waters
Wisdom is stale to Me
The Service without Hope
Is tenderest I think
Because tis unsustained
By stintRewarded Work
Has impetus of Gain
And impetus of Goal
There is no Diligence like that
That knows not an Until
The show is not the show
But they that go
Menagerie to me
My neighbor be
Fair play
Both went to see
The Skies cant keep their secret
They tell it to the Hills
The Hills just tell the Orchards
And theythe Daffodils
A Birdby chancethat goes that way
Soft overhears the whole
If I should bribe the little Bird
Who knows but she would tell
I think I wonthowever
Its finernot to know
If Summer were an Axiom
What sorcery had Snow
So keep your secretFather
I would notif I could
Know what the Sapphire Fellows do
In your newfashioned world
The sky is low the clouds are mean
A travelling flake of snow
Across a barn or through a rut
Debates if it will go
A narrow wind complains all day
How some one treated him
Nature like us is sometimes caught
Without her diadem
The Snow that never drifts
The transient fragrant snow
That comes a single time a Year
Is softly driving now
So thorough in the Tree
At night beneath the star
That it was Februarys Foot
Experience would swear
Like Winter as a Face
We stern and former knew
Repaired of all but Loneliness
By Natures Alibit
Were every storm so spice
The Value could not be
We buy with contrast Pang is good
As near as memory
The Soul has Bandaged moments
When too appalled to stir
She feels some ghastly Fright come up
And stop to look at her
Salute herwith long fingers
Caress her freezing hair
Sip Goblin from the very lips
The Loverhoveredoer
Unworthy that a thought so mean
Accost a Themesofair
The soul has moments of Escape
When bursting all the doors
She dances like a Bomb abroad
And swings upon the Hours
As do the Beedelirious borne
Long Dungeoned from his Rose
Touch Libertythen know no more
But Noon and Paradise
The Souls retaken moments
When Felon led along
With shackles on the plumed feet
And staples in the Song
The Horror welcomes her again
These are not brayed of Tongue
The Souls distinct connection
With immortality
Is best disclosed by Danger
Or quick Calamity
As Lightning on a Landscape
Exhibits Sheets of Place
Not yet suspectedbut for Flash
And Clickand Suddenness
The Souls Superior instants
Occur to Heralone
When friendand Earths occasion
Have infinite withdrawn
Or SheHerselfascended
To too remote a Height
For lower Recognition
Than Her Omnipotent
This Mortal Abolition
Is seldombut as fair
As Apparitionsubject
To Autocratic Air
Eternitys disclosure
To favoritesa few
Of the Colossal substance
Of Immortality
The Soul selects her own Society
Then shuts the Door
To her divine Majority
Present no more
Unmoved she notes the Chariots pausing
At her low Gate
Unmoved an Emperor be kneeling
Upon her Mat
Ive known her from an ample nation
Choose One
Then close the Valves of her attention
Like Stone
The Soul that hath a Guest
Doth seldom go abroad
Diviner Crowd at Home
Obliterate the need
And Courtesy forbid
A Hosts departure when
Upon Himself be visiting
The Emperor of Men
The Soul unto itself
Is an imperial friend
Or the most agonizing Spy
An Enemy could send
Secure against its own
No treason it can fear
Itself its Sovereign of itself
The Soul should stand in Awe
The Spider as an Artist
Has never been employed
Though his surpassing Merit
Is freely certified
By every Broom and Bridget
Throughout a Christian Land
Neglected Son of Genius
I take thee by the Hand
The spider holds a Silver Ball
In unperceived Hands
And dancing softly to Himself
His Yarn of Pearlunwinds
He plies from Nought to Nought
In unsubstantial Trade
Supplants our Tapestries with His
In half the period
An Hour to rear supreme
His Continents of Light
Then dangle from the Housewifes Broom
His Boundariesforgot
The Spirit is the Conscious Ear
We actually Hear
When We inspectthats audible
That is admittedHere
For other Servicesas Sound
There hangs a smaller Ear
Outside the Castlethat Contain
The otheronlyHear
The spry Arms of the Wind
If I could crawl between
I have an errand imminent
To an adjoining Zone
I should not care to stop
My Process is not long
The Wind could wait without the Gate
Or stroll the Town among
To ascertain the House
And is the soul at Home
And hold the Wick of mine to it
To light and then return
The Sun and Moon must make their haste
The Stars express around
For in the Zones of Paradise
The Lord alone is burned
His Eye it is the East and West
The North and South when He
Do concentrate His Countenance
Like Glow Worms flee away
Oh Poor and Far
Oh Hindred Eye
That hunted for the Day
The Lord a Candle entertains
Entirely for Thee
The Sun is gay or stark
According to our Deed
If Merry He is merrier
If eager for the Dead
Or an expended Day
He helped to make too bright
His mighty pleasure suits Us not
It magnifies our Freight
The Sunjust touched the Morning
The MorningHappy thing
Supposed that He had come to dwell
And Life would all be Spring
She felt herself supremer

Leaving a new necessity
The want of Diadems

Her unanointed forehead

The Sun kept settingsettingstill
No Hue of Afternoon
Upon the Village I perceived
From House to House twas Noon
The Dusk kept droppingdroppingstill
No Dew upon the Grass
But only on my Forehead stopped
And wandered in my Face
My Feet kept drowsingdrowsingstill
My fingers were awake
Yet why so little soundMyself
Unto my Seemingmake
How well I knew the Light before
I could see it now
Tis DyingI am doingbut
Im not afraid to know
The Sun kept stoopingstoopinglow
The Hills to meet him rose
On his side what Transaction
On their side what Repose
Deeper and deeper grew the stain
Upon the window pane
Thicker and thicker stood the feet
Until the Tyrian
Was crowded dense with Armies
So gay so Brigadier
That I felt martial stirrings
Who once the Cockade wore
Charged from my chimney corner
But Nobody was there
The Sunrise runs for Both

The Noon unwinds Her Blue
Till One Breadth cover Two

Nor does the Night forget
A Lamp for Eachto set

And so

And One upon Her Hem

The Sunset stopped on Cottages
Where Sunset hence must be
For treason not of His but Lifes
Gone Westerly Today
The Sunset stopped on Cottages
Where Morning just begun
What difference after all Thou makst
Thou supercilious Sun
The sweetest Heresy received
That Man and Woman know
Each Others Convert
Though the Faith accommodate but Two
The Churches are so frequent

The Grace so unavoidable
To failis Infidel

The thought beneath so slight a film
Is more distincly seen
As laces just reveal the surge
Or mists the Apennine
The Tint I cannot takeis best
The Color too remote
That I could show it in Bazaar
A Guinea at a sight
The fineimpalpable Array
That swaggers on the eye
Like Cleopatras Company
Repeatedin the sky
The Moments of Dominion
That happen on the Soul
And leave it with a Discontent
Too exquisiteto tell
The eager lookon Landscapes
As if they just repressed
Some Secretthat was pushing
Like Chariotsin the Vest
The Pleading of the Summer
That other Prankof Snow
That Cushions Mystery with Tulle
For fear the Squirrelsknow
Their Graspless mannersmock us
Until the Cheated Eye
Shuts arrogantlyin the Grave
Another wayto see
The Trees like Tasselshitand swung
There seemed to rise a Tune
From Miniature Creatures
Accompanying the Sun
Far Psalteries of Summer
Enamoring the Ear
They never yet did satisfy
Remotestwhen most fair
The Sun shone whole at intervals
Then Halfthen utter hid
As if Himself were optional
And had Estates of Cloud
Sufficient to enfold Him
Eternally from view
Except it were a whim of His
To let the Orchards grow
A Bird sat careless on the fence
One gossipped in the Lane
On silver matters charmed a Snake
Just winding round a Stone
Bright Flowers slit a Calyx
And soared upon a Stem
Like Hindered FlagsSweet hoisted
With Spicesin the Hem
Twas moreI cannot mention
How meanto those that see
Vandykes Delineation
Of NaturesSummer Day
The Truthis stirless
Other forcemay be presumed to move
Thisthenis best for confidence
When oldest Cedars swerve
And Oaks untwist their fists
And Mountainsfeeblelean
How excellent a Body that
Stands without a Bone
How vigorous a Force
That holds without a Prop
Truth stays Herselfand every man
That trusts Herboldly up
The Veins of other Flowers
The Scarlet Flowers are
Till Nature leisure has for Terms
As Branch and Jugular
We pass and she abides
We conjugate Her Skill
While She creates and federates
Without a syllable
The Way I read a Lettersthis
Tis firstI lock the Door
And push it with my fingersnext
For transport it be sure
And then I go the furthest off
To counteract a knock
Then draw my little Letter forth
And slowly pick the lock
Thenglancing narrow at the Wall
And narrow at the floor
For firm Conviction of a Mouse
Not exorcised before
Peruse how infinite I am
To no one that Youknow
And sigh for lack of Heavenbut not
The Heaven God bestow
Dare you see a Soul at the White Heat
Then crouch within the door
Red is the Fires common tint
But when the vivid Ore
Has vanquished Flames conditions
It quivers from the Forge
Without a color but the light
Of unanointed Blaze
Least Village has its Blacksmith
Whose Anvils even ring
Stands symbol for the finer Forge
That soundless tugs within
Refining these impatient Ores
With Hammer and with Blaze
Untile the Designated Light
Repudiate the Forge
The Whole of it came not at once
Twas Murder by degrees
A Thrustand then for Life a chance
The Bliss to cauterize
The Cat reprieves the Mouse
She eases from her teeth
Just long enough for Hope to tease
Then mashes it to death
Tis Lifes awardto die
Contenteder if once
Than dying halfthen rallying
For consciouser Eclipse
first version
The Wind begun to knead the Grass
As Women do a Dough
He flung a Hand full at the Plain
A Hand full at the Sky
The Leaves unhooked themselves from Trees
And started all abroad
The Dust did scoop itself like Hands
And throw away the Road
The Wagonsquickened on the Street
The Thunders gossiped low
The Lightning showed a Yellow Head
And then a livid Toe
The Birds put up the Bars to Nests
The Cattle flung to Barns
Then came one drop of Giant Rain
And then as if the Hands
That held the Damshad parted hold
The Waters Wrecked the Sky
But overlooked my Fathers House
Just Quartering a Tree
second version
The Wind begun to rock the Grass
With threatening Tunes and low
He threw a Menace at the Earth
A Menace at the Sky
The Leaves unhooked themselves from Trees
And started all abroad
The Dust did scoop itself like Hands
And threw away the Road
The Wagons quickened on the Streets
The Thunder hurried slow
The Lightning showed a Yellow Beak
And then a livid Claw
The Birds put up the Bars to Nests
The Cattle fled to Barns
There came one drop of Giant Rain
And then as if the Hands
That held the Dams had parted hold
The Waters Wrecked the Sky
But overlooked my Fathers House
Just quartering a Tree
The wind begun to rock the grass
With threatening tunes and low
He flung a menace at the earth
A menace at the sky
The leaves unhooked themselves from trees
And started all abroad
The dust did scoop itself like hands
And throw away the road
The wagons quickened on the streets
The thunder hurried slow
The lightning showed a yellow beak
And then a livid claw
The birds put up the bars to nests
The cattle fled to barns
There came one drop of giant rain
And then as if the hands
That held the dams had parted hold
The waters wrecked the sky
But overlooked my fathers house
lust quartering a tree
The Wind didnt come from the Orchardtoday
Further than that
Nor stop to play with the Hay
Nor joggle a Hat
Hes a transitive fellowvery
Rely on that
If He leave a Bur at the door
We know He has climbed a Fir
But the Fir is WhereDeclare
Were you ever there
If He brings Odors of Clovers
And that is His businessnot Ours
Then He has been with the Mowers
Whetting away the Hours
To sweet pauses of Hay
His Wayof a June Day
If He fling Sand and Pebble
Little Boys Hatsand Stubble
With an occasional Steeple
And a hoarse Get out of the way I say
Whod be the fool to stay
Would youSay
Would you be the fool to stay
The wind tapped like a tired man
And like a host Come in
I boldly answered entered then
My residence within
A rapid footless guest
To offer whom a chair
Were as impossible as hand
A sofa to the air
No bone had he to bind him
His speech was like the push
Of numerous hummingbirds at once
From a superior bush
His countenance a billow
His fingers if he pass
Let go a music as of tunes
Blown tremulous in glass
He visited still flitting
Then like a timid man
Again he tapped t was flurriedly
And I became alone
The Wind took up the Northern Things
And piled them in the south
Then gave the East unto the West
And opening his mouth
The four Divisions of the Earth
Did make as to devour
While everything to corners slunk
Behind the awful power
The Wind unto his Chambers went
And nature ventured out
Her subjects scattered into place
Her systems ranged about
Again the smoke from Dwellings rose
The Day abroad was heard
How intimate a Tempest past
The Transport of the Bird
The Winters are so short
Im hardly justified
In sending all the Birds away
And moving into Pod
Myselffor scarcely settled
The Phoebes have begun
And thenits time to strike my Tent
And open Houseagain
Its mostly interruptions
My Summeris despoiled
Because there was a Winteronce
And al the Cattlestarved
And so there was a Deluge
And swept the World away
But Ararats a Legendnow
And no one credits Noah
His bill an auger is
His head a cap and frill
He laboreth at every tree
A worm his utmost goal
The words the happy say
Are paltry melody
But those the silent feel
Are beautiful
The Work of Her that went
The Toil of Fellows done
In Ovens green our Mother bakes
By Fires of the Sun
The Worldfeels Dusty
When We stop to Die
We want the Dewthen
Honorstaste dry
Flagsvex a Dying face
But the least Fan
Stirred by a friends Hand
Coolslike the Rain
Mine be the Ministry
When they Thirst comes
And Hybla Balms
Dews of Thessaly to fetch
The Worldstandssolemnerto me
Since I was wedto Him
A modesty befits the soul

The Zeroestaught usPhosphorous
We learned to like the Fire
By playing Glacierswhen a Boy
And Tinderguessedby power

If Whitea Redmust be

Unto Vitality
Their Height in Heaven comforts not
Their Glorynought to me
Twas best imperfectas it was
Im finiteI cant see
The House of Supposition
The Glimmering Frontier that
Skirts the Acres of Perhaps
To Meshows insecure
The Wealth I hadcontented me
If twas a meaner size
Then I had counted it until
It pleased my narrow Eyes
Better than larger values
That show however true
This timid life of Evidence
Keeps pleadingI dont know
There are two Ripeningsoneof sight
Whose forces Spheric wind
Until the Velvet product
Drop spicy to the ground
A homelier maturing
A process in the Bur
That teeth of Frosts alone disclose
In far October Air
There came a Day at Summers full
Entirely for me
I thought that such were for the Saints
Where Resurrectionsbe
The Sun as common went abroad
The flowers accustomed blew
As if no soul the solstice passed
That maketh all things new
The time was scarce profaned by speech
The symbol of a word
Was needless as at Sacrament
The Wardrobeof our Lord
Each was to each The Sealed Church
Permitted to commune thistime
Lest we too awkward show
At Supper of the Lamb
The Hours slid fastas Hours will
Clutched tight by greedy hands
So faces on two Decks look back
Bound to opposing lands
And so when all the time had leaked
Without external sound
Each bound the Others Crucifix
We gave no other Bond
Sufficient troth that we shall rise
Deposedat length the Grave
To that new Marriage
Justifiedthrough Calvaries of Love
There cam a Wind like a Bugle
It quivered through the Grass
And a Green Chill upon the Heat
So ominous did pass
We barred the Windows and the Doors
As from an Emerald Ghost
The Dooms electric Moccasin
The very instant passed
On a strange Mob of panting Trees
And Fences fled away
And Rivers where the Houses ran
Those looked that lived that Day
The Bell within the steeple wild
The flying tidings told
How much can come
And much can go
And yet abide the World
There comes a warning like a spy
A shorter breath of Day
A stealing that is not a stealth
And Summers are away
There is a finished feeling
Experienced at Graves
A leisure of the Future
A Wilderness of Size
By Deaths bold Exhibition
Preciser what we are
And the Eternal function
Enabled to infer
There is a flower that Bees prefer
And Butterfliesdesire
To gain the Purple Democrat
The Humming Birdaspire
And Whatsoever Insect pass
A Honey bear away
Proportioned to his several dearth
And hercapacity
Her face be rounder than the Moon
And ruddier than the Gown
Or Orchis in the Pasture
Or Rhododendronworn
She doth not wait for June
Before the World be Green
Her sturdy little Countenance
Against the Windbe seen
Contending with the Grass
Near Kinsman to Herself
For Privilege of Sod and Sun
Sweet Litigants for Life
And when the Hills be full
And newer fashions blow
Doth not retract a single spice
For pang of jealousy
Her Publicbe the Noon
Her Providencethe Sun
Her Progressby the Beeproclaimed
In sovereignSwerveless Tune
The Bravestof the Host
Surrenderingthe last
Nor even of Defeataware
What cancelled by the Frost
There is a June when Corn is cut
And Roses in the Seed
A Summer briefer than the first
But tenderer indeed
As should a Face supposed the Graves
Emerge a single Noon
In the Vermilion that it wore
Affect us and return
Two Seasons it is said exist
The Summer of the Just
And this of Ours diversified
With Prospect and with Frost
May not our Second with its First
So infinite compare
That We but recollect the one
The other to prefer
There is a Languor of the Life
More imminent than Pain
Tis Pains SuccessorWhen the Soul
Has suffered all it can
A Drowsinessdiffuses
A Dimness like a Fog
Envelops Consciousness
As Mistsobliterate a Crag
The Surgeondoes not blanchat pain
His Habitis severe
But tell him that it ceased to feel
The Creature lying there
And he will tell youskill is late
A Mightier than He
Has ministered before Him
Theres no Vitality
There is a morn by men unseen
Whose maids upon remoter green
Keep their Seraphic May
And all day long with dance and game
And gambol I may never name
Employ their holiday
Here to light measure move the feet
Which walk no more the village street
Nor by the wood are found
Here are the birds that sought the sun
When last years distaff idle hung
And summers brows were bound
Neer saw I such a wondrous scene
Neer such a ring on such a green
Nor so serene array
As if the stars some summer night
Should swing their cups of Chrysolite
And revel till the day
Like thee to dancelike thee to sing
People upon the mystic green
I ask each new May Morn
I wait thy far fantastic bells
Unto the different dawn
There is a painso utter
It swallows substance up
Then covers the Abyss with Trance
So Memory can step
Aroundacrossupon it
As one within a Swoon
Goes safelywhere an open eye
Would drop HimBone by Bone
There is a Shame of Nobleness
Confronting Sudden Pelf
A finer Shame of Ecstasy
Convicted of Itself
A best Disgracea Brave Man feels
Acknowledgedof the Brave
One MoreYe Blessedto be told
But thatsBehind the Grave
There is a word
Which bears a sword
Can pierce an armed man
It hurls its barbed syllables
And is mute again
But where it fell
The saved will tell
On patriotic day
Some epauletted Brother
Gave his breath away
Wherever runs the breathless sun
Wherever roams the day
There is its noiseless onset
There is its victory
Behold the keenest marksman
The most accomplished shot
Times sublimest target
Is a soul forgot
There is an arid Pleasure
As different from Joy
As Frost is different from Dew
Like elementare they
Yet onerejoices Flowers
And onethe Flowers abhor
The finest Honeycurdled
Is worthlessto the Bee
There is another Loneliness
That many die without
Not want of friend occasions it
Or circumstances of Lot
But nature sometimes sometimes thought
And whoso it befall
Is richer than could be revealed
By mortal numeral
There is another sky
Ever serene and fair
And there is another sunshine
Though it be darkness there
Never mind faded forests Austin
Never mind silent fields
Here is a little forest
Whose leaf is ever green
Here is a brighter garden
Where not a frost has been
In its unfading flowers
I hear the bright bee hum
Prithee my brother
Into my garden come
There is no frigate like a book
To take us lands away
Nor any coursers like a page
Of prancing poetry
This traverse may the poorest take
Without oppress of toll
How frugal is the chariot
That bears a human soul
There is no Silence in the Earth so silent
As that endured
Which uttered would discourage Nature
And haunt the World
Theres a certain Slant of light
Winter Afternoons
That oppresses like the Heft
Of Cathedral Tunes
Heavenly Hurt it gives us
We can find no scar
But internal difference
Where the Meanings are
None may teach itAny
Tis the Seal Despair
An imperial affliction
Sent us of the air
When it comes the Landscape listens
Shadowshold their breath
When it goes tis like the Distance
On the look of Death
Theres been a death in the opposite house
As lately as today
I know it by the numb look
Such houses have alway
The neighbors rustle in and out
The doctor drives away
A window opens like a pod
Abrupt mechanically
Somebody flings a mattress out
The children hurry by
They wonder if It died on that
I used to when a boy
The minister goes stiffly in
As if the house were his
And he owned all the mourners now
And little boys besides
And then the milliner and the man
Of the appalling trade
To take the measure of the house
Therell be that dark parade
Of tassels and of coaches soon
Its easy as a sign
The intuition of the news
In just a country town
Theres something quieter than sleep
Within this inner room
It wears a sprig upon its breast
And will not tell its name
Some touch it and some kiss it
Some chafe its idle hand
It has a simple gravity
I do not understand
I would not weep if I were they
How rude in one to sob
Might scare the quiet fairy
Back to her native wood
While simplehearted neighbors
Chat of the Early dead
Weprone to periphrasis
Remark that Birds have fled
These are the days when Birds come back
A very fewa Bird or two
To take a backward look
These are the days when skies resume
The oldold sophistries of June
A blue and gold mistake
Oh fraud that cannot cheat the Bee
Almost thy plausibility
Induces my belief
Till ranks of seeds their witness bear
And softly thro the altered air
Hurries a timid leaf
Oh Sacrament of summer days
Oh Last Communion in the Haze
Permit a child to join
Thy sacred emblems to partake
They consecrated bread to take
And thine immortal wine
These Fevered Days to take them to the Forest
Where Waters cool around the mosses crawl
And shade is all that devastates the stillness
Seems it sometimes this would be all
Thesesaw Visions
Latch them softly
Theseheld Dimples
Smooth them slow
Thisaddressed departing accents
QuickSweet Mouthto miss thee so
ThisWe stroked
Unnumbered Satin
Thesewe held among our own
Fingers of the Slim Aurora
Not so arrogantthis Noon
Theseadjustthat ran to meet us
Pearlfor StockingPearl for Shoe
Paradisethe only Palace
Fit for Her receptionnow
These tested Our Horizon
Then disappeared
As Birds before achieving
A Latitude
Our Retrospection of Them
A fixed Delight
But our Anticipation
A Dicea Doubt
They ask but our Delight
The Darlings of the Soil
And grant us all their Countenance
For a penurious smile
They called me to the Window for
 Twas SunsetSome one said
I only saw a Sapphire Farm
And just a Single Herd
Of Opal Cattlefeeding far
Upon so vain a Hill
As even while I lookeddissolved
Nor Cattle werenor Soil
But in their steada Seadisplayed
And Shipsof such a size
As Crew of Mountainscould afford
And Decksto seat the skies
Thistoothe Showman rubbed away
And when I looked again
Nor Farmnor Opal Herdwas there
Nor Mediterranean
They dropped like flakes they dropped like stars
Like petals from a rose
When suddenly across the lune
A wind with fingers goes
They perished in the seamless grass
No eye could find the place
But God on his repealless list
Can summon every face
They have a little Odorthat to me
Is metrenaytis melody
And spiciest at fadingindicate
A Habitof a Laureate
They have not chosen me he said
But I have chosen them
BraveBroken hearted statement
Uttered in Bethlehem
I could not have told it
But since Jesus dared
Sovereign Know a Daisy
They dishonor shared
They leave us with the Infinite
But Heis not a man
His fingers are the size of fists
His fists the size of men
And whom he foundeth with his Arm
As Himmaleh shall stand
Gibraltars Everlasting Shoe
Poised lightly on his Hand
So trust him Comrade
You for you and I for you and me
Eternity is ample
And quick enough if true
They put Us far apart
As separate as Sea
And Her unsown Peninsula
We signified These see
They took away our Eyes
They thwarted Us with Guns
I see Thee each responded straight
Through Telegraphic Signs
With DungeonsThey devised
But through their thickest skill
And their opaquest Adamant
Our Souls sawjust as well
They summoned Us to die
With sweet alacrity
We stood upon our stapled feet
Condemnedbut justto see
Permission to recant
Permission to forget
We turned our backs upon the Sun
For perjury of that
Not Eithernoticed Death
Of Paradiseaware
Each others Facewas all the Disc
Each others settingsaw
They say that time assuages
Time never did assuage
An actual suffering strengthens
As sinews do with age
Time is a test of trouble
But not a remedy
If such it prove it prove too
There was no malady
They shut me up in Prose
As when a little Girl
They put me in the Closet
Because they liked me still
Still Could themself have peeped
And seen my Brain go round
They might as wise have lodged a Bird
For Treason in the Pound
Himself has but to will
And easy as a Star
Abolish his Captivity
And laugh No more have I
They wont frown alwayssome sweet Day
When I forget to tease
Theyll recollect how cold I looked
And how I just said Please
Then They will hasten to the Door
To call the little Girl
Who cannot thank Them for the Ice
That filled the lisping full
This Bauble was preferred of Bees
By Butterflies admired
At HeavenlyHopeless Distances
Was justified of Bird
Did Noonenamelin Herself
Was Summer to a Score
Who only knew of Universe
It had created Her
This Chasm Sweet upon my life
I mention it to you
When Sunrise through a fissure drop
The Day must follow too
If we demur its gaping sides
Disclose as twere a Tomb
Ourself am lying straight wherein
The Favorite of Doom
When it has just contained a Life
Then Darling it will close
And yet so bolder every Day
So turbulent it grows
Im tempted half to stitch it up
With a remaining Breath
I should not miss in yielding though
To Him it would be Death
And so I bear it big about
My Burialbefore
A Life quite ready to depart
Can harass me no more
This Consciousness that is aware
Of Neighbors and the Sun
Will be the one aware of Death
And that itself alone
Is traversing the interval
Experience between
And most profound experiment
Appointed unto Men
How adequate unto itself
Its properties shall be
Itself unto itself and none
Shall make discovery
Adventure most unto itself
The Soul condemned to be
Attended by a single Hound
Its own identity
This Dust and its Feature
AccreditedToday
This heart that broke so long
These feet that never flagged
This faith that watched for star in vain
Give gently to the dead
Hound cannot overtake the Hare
That fluttered panting here
Nor any schoolboy rob the nest
Tenderness builded there
This is a Blossom of the Brain
A smallitalic Seed
Lodged by Design or Happening
The Spirit fructified
Shy as the Wind of his Chambers
Swift as a Freshets Tongue
So of the Flower of the Soul
Its process is unknown
When it is found a few rejoice
The Wise convey it Home
Carefully cherishing the spot
If other Flower become
When it is lost that Day shall be
The Funeral of God
Upon his Breast a closing Soul
The Flower of our Lord
This is my letter to the world
That never wrote to me
The simple news that Nature told
With tender majesty
Her message is committed
To hands I cannot see
For love of her sweet countrymen
Judge tenderly of me
This is the land the sunset washes
These are the banks of the Yellow Sea
Where it rose or whither it rushes
These are the western mystery
Night after night her purple traffic
Strews the landing with opal bales
Merchantmen poise upon horizons
Dip and vanish with fairy sails
Thisis the landthe Sunset washes
Theseare the Banks of the Yellow Sea
Where it roseor whither it rushes
Theseare the Western Mystery
Night after Night
Her purple traffic
Strews the landing with Opal Bales
Merchantmenpoise upon Horizons
Dipand vanish like Orioles
This Merit hath the worst
It cannot be again
When Fate hath taunted last
And thrown Her furthest Stone
The Maimed may pause and breathe
And glance securely round
The Deer attracts no further
Than it resiststhe Hound
This quiet dust was gentlemen and ladies
And lads and girls
Was laughter and ability and sighing
And frocks and curls
This passive place a summers nimble mansion
Where bloom and bees
Fulfilled their oriental circuit
Then ceased like these
This that would greetan hour ago
Is quaintest Distancenow
Had it a Guest from Paradise
Nor glow would it nor bow
Had it a notice from the Noon
Nor beam would it nor warm
Match me the Silver Reticence
Match me the Solid Calm
This was a PoetIt is That
Distills amazing sense
From ordinary Meanings
And Attar so immense
From the familiar species
That perished by the Door
We wonder it was not Ourselves
Arrested itbefore
Of Pictures the Discloser
The Poetit is He
Entitles Usby Contrast
To ceaseless Poverty
Of portionso unconscious
The Robbingcould not harm
Himselfto Hima Fortune
Exteriorto Time
This was in the White of the Year
Thatwas in the Green
Drifts were as difficult then to think
As Daisies now to be seen
Looking back is best that is left
Or if it bebefore
Retrospection is Prospects half
Sometimes almost more
This World is not Conclusion
A Species stands beyond
Invisible as Music
But positive as Sound
It beckons and it baffles
Philosophydont know
And through a Riddle at the last
Sagacity must go
To guess it puzzles scholars
To gain it Men have borne
Contempt of Generations
And Crucifixion shown
Faith slipsand laughs and rallies
Blushes if any see
Plucks at a twig of Evidence
And asks a Vane the way
Much Gesture from the Pulpit
Strong Hallelujahs roll
Narcotics cannot still the Tooth
That nibbles at the soul
Tho I get home how latehow late
So I get home twill compensate
Better will be the Ecstasy
That they have done expecting me
When Nightdescendingdumband dark
They hear my unexpected knock
Transporting must the moment be
Brewed from decades of Agony
To think just how the fire will burn
Just how longcheated eyes will turn
To wonder what myself will say
And what itself will say to me
Beguiles the Centuries of way
Tho my destiny be Fustian
Hers be damask fine
Tho she wear a silver apron
I a less divine
Still my little Gypsy being
I would far prefer
Still my little sunburnt bosom
To her Rosier
For when Frosts their punctual fingers
On her forehead lay
You and I and Dr Holland
Bloom Eternally
Roses of a steadfast summer
In a steadfast land
Where no Autumn lifts her pencil
And no Reapers stand
Those fairfictitious People
The Womenplucked away
From our familiar Lifetime
The Men of Ivory
Those Boys and Girls in Canvas
Who stay upon the Wall
In Everlasting Keepsake
Can Anybody tell
We trustin places perfecter
Inheriting Delight
Beyond our faint Conjecture
Our dizzy Estimate
Remembering ourselves we trust
Yet Blessederthan We
Through Knowingwhere We only hope
Receivingwhere wepray
Of Expectationalso
Anticipating us
With transport that would be a pain
Except for Holiness
Esteeming usas Exile
Themselfadmitted Home
Through easy Miracle of Death
The Way ourself must come
Those who have been in the Grave the longest
Those who begin Today
Equally perish from our Practise
Death is the other way
Foot of the Bold did least attempt it
Itis the White Exploit
Once to achieve annuls the power
Once to communicate
Three timeswe partedBreathand I
Three timesHe would not go
But strove to stir the lifeless Fan
The Watersstrove to stay
Three Timesthe Billows tossed me up
Then caught melike a Ball
Then made Blue faces in my face
And pushed away a sail
That crawled Leagues offI liked to see
For thinkingwhile I die
How pleasant to behold a Thing
Where Human facesbe
The Waves grew sleepyBreathdid not
The Windslike Childrenlulled
Then Sunrise kissed my Chrysalis
And I stood upand lived
Through lane it laythrough bramble
Through clearing and through wood
Banditti often passed us
Upon the lonely road
The wolf came peering curious
The owl looked puzzled down
The serpents satin figure
Glid stealthily along
The tempests touched our garments
The lightnings poinards gleamed
Fierce from the Crag above us
The hungry Vulture screamed
The satyrs fingers beckoned
The valley murmured Come
These were the mates
This was the road
Those children fluttered home
Through the Dark Sodas Education
The Lily passes sure
Feels her white footno trepidation
Her faithno fear
Afterwardin the Meadow
Swinging her Beryl Bell
The Moldlifeall forgottennow
In Ecstasyand Dell
Through the strait pass of suffering
The Martyrseventrod
Their feetupon Temptations
Their facesupon God
A statelyshrivenCompany
Con vulsionplaying round
Harmlessas streaks of Meteor
Upon a Planets Bond
Their faiththe everlasting troth
Their Expectationfair
The Needleto the North Degree
Wadessothro polar Air
Tie the strings to my life my Lord
Then I am ready to go
Just a look at the horses
Rapid That will do
Put me in on the firmest side
So I shall never fall
For we must ride to the Judgment
And its partly down hill
But never I mind the bridges
And never I mind the sea
Held fast in everlasting race
By my own choice and thee
Goodby to the life I used to lives
And the world I used to know
And kiss the hills for me just once
Now I am ready to go
Till Deathis narrow Loving
The scantest Heart extant
Will hold you till your privilege
Of Finitenessbe spent
But He whose loss procures you
Such Destitution that
Your Life too abject for itself
Thenceforward imitate
UntilResemblance perfect
Yourself for His pursuit
Delight of Natureabdicate
Exhibit Lovesomewhat
Time feels so vast that were it not
For an Eternity
I fear me this Circumference
Engross my Finity
To His exclusion who prepare
By Processes of Size
For the Stupendous Vision
Of his diameters
Tis Anguish grander than Delight
Tis Resurrection Pain
The meeting Bands of smitten Face
We questioned to again
Tis Transport wild as thrills the Graves
When Cerements let go
And Creatures clad in Miracle
Go up by Two and Two
Tis customary as we part
A trinketto confer
It helps to stimulate the faith
When Lovers be afar
Tis variousas the various taste
Clematisjourneying far
Presents me with a single Curl
Of her Electric Hair
Tis goodthe looking back on Grief
To reendure a Day
We thought the Mighty Funeral
Of All Conceived Joy
To recollect how Busy Grass
Did meddleone by one
Till all the Grief with Summerwaved
And none could see the stone
And though the Woe you have Today
Be largerAs the Sea
Exceeds its Unremembered Drop
Theyre Waterequally
Tis little Icould care for Pearls
Who own the ample sea
Or Broocheswhen the Emperor
With Rubiespelteth me
Or Goldwho am the Prince of Mines
Or Diamondswhen have I
A Diadem to fit a Dom
Continual upon me
Tis not that Dying hurts us so
Tis Livinghurts us more
But Dyingis a different way
A Kind behind the Door
The Southern Customof the Bird
That ere the Frosts are due
Accepts a better Latitude
Weare the Birdsthat stay
The Shrivers round Farmers doors
For whose reluctant Crumb
We stipulatetill pitying Snows
Persuade our Feathers Home
Tis One by One the Father counts
And then a Tract between
Set Cypherless to teach the Eye
The Value of its Ten
Until the peevish Student
Acquire the Quick of Skill
Then Numerals are dowered back
Adorning all the Rule
Tis mostly Slate and Pencil
And Darkness on the School
Distracts the Childrens fingers
Still the Eternal Rule
Regards least Cypherer alike
With Leader of the Band
And every separate Urchins Sum
Is fashioned for his hand
Tis Oppositesentice
Deformed Menponder Grace
Bright firesthe Blanketless
The LostDays face
The Blindesteem it be
Enough Estateto see
The Captivestrangles new
For deemingBeggarsplay
To lackenamor Thee
Tho the Divinity
Be only
Me
Tis so appallingit exhilarates
So over Horror it half Captivates
The Soul stares after it secure
A Sepulchre fears frost no more
To scan a Ghost is faint
But grappling conquers it
How easy Torment now
Suspense kept sawing so
The Truth is Bald and Cold
But that will hold
If any are not sure
We show themprayer
But we who know
Stop hoping now
Looking at Death is Dying
Just let go the Breath
And not the pillow at your Cheek
So Slumbereth
Others Can wrestle
Yours is done
And so of Woe bleak dreadedcome
It sets the Fright at liberty
And Terrors free
Gay Ghastly Holiday
Tis so much joy Tis so much joy
If I should fail what poverty
And yet as poor as I
Have ventured all upon a throw
Have gained Yes Hesitated so
This side the Victory
Life is but Life And Death but Death
Bliss is but Bliss and Breath but Breath
And if indeed I fail
At least to know the worst is sweet
Defeat means nothing but Defeat
No drearier can befall
And if I gain Oh Gun at Sea
Oh Bells that in the Steeples be
At first repeat it slow
For Heaven is a different thing
Conjectured and waked sudden in
And might extinguish me
Tis SunriseLittle MaidHast Thou
No Station in the Day
Twas not thy wont to hinder so
Retrieve thine industry
Tis NoonMy little Maid
Alasand art thou sleeping yet
The Lilywaiting to be Wed
The BeeHast thou forgot
My little MaidTis NightAlas
That Night should be to thee
Instead of MorningHadst thou broached
Thy little Plan to Die
Dissuade thee if I could not Sweet
I might have aidedthee
Tis trueThey shut me in the Cold
But thenThemselves were warm
And could not know the feeling twas
Forget itLordof Them
Let not my Witness hinder Them
In Heavenly esteem
No Paradise could beConferred
Through Their beloved Blame
The Harm They didwas shortAnd since
Myselfwho bore itdo
Forgive ThemEven as Myself
Or elseforgive not me
To be aliveis Power
Existencein itself
Without a further function
OmnipotenceEnough
To be aliveand Will
Tis able as a God
The Makerof Ourselvesbe what
Such being Finitude
To dietakes just a little while
They say it doesnt hurt
Its only fainterby degrees
And thenits out of sight
A darker Ribbonfor a Day
A Crape upon the Hat
And then the pretty sunshine comes
And helps us to forget
The absentmysticcreature
That but for love of us
Had gone to sleepthat soundest time
Without the weariness
To dietakes just a little while
They say it doesnt hurt
Its only fainterby degrees
And thenits out of sight
A darker Ribbonfor a Day
A Crape upon the Hat
And then the pretty sunshine comes
And helps us to forget
The absentmysticcreature
That but for love of us
Had gone to sleepthat soundest time
Without the weariness
To fight aloud is very brave
But gallanter I know
Who charge within the bosom
The Cavalry of Woe
Who win and nations do not see
Who falland none observe
Whose dying eyes no Country
Regards with patriot love
We trust in plumed procession
For such the Angels go
Rank after Rank with even feet
And Uniforms of Snow
To fill a Gap
Insert the Thing that caused it
Block it up
With Otherand twill yawn the more
You cannot solder an Abyss
With Air
To flee from memory
Had we the Wings
Many would fly
Inured to slower things
Birds with surprise
Would scan the cowering Van
Of men escaping
From the mind of man
To hang our headostensibly
And subsequent to find
That such was not the posture
Of our immortal mind
Affords the sly presumption
That in so dense a fuzz
Youtootake Cobweb attitudes
Upon a plane of Gauze
To hear an Oriole sing
May be a common thing
Or only a divine
It is not of the Bird
Who sings the same unheard
As unto Crowd
The Fashion of the Ear
Attireth that it hear
In Dun or fair
So whether it be Rune
Or whether it be none
Is of within
The Tune is in the Tree
The Skepticshoweth me
No Sir In Thee
To interrupt His Yellow Plan
The Sun does not allow
Caprices of the Atmosphere
And even when the Snow
Heaves Balls of Specks like Vicious Boy
Directly in His Eye
Does not so much as turn His Head
Busy with Majesty
Tis His to stimulate the Earth
And magnetize the Sea
And bind Astronomy in place
Yet Any passing by
Would deem Ourselvesthe busier
As the Minutest Bee
That ridesemits a Thunder
A Bombto justify
To know just how He sufferedwould be dear
To know if any Human eyes were near
To whom He could entrust His wavering gaze
Until it settle broadon Paradise
To know if He was patientpart content
Was Dying as He thoughtor different
Was it a pleasant Day to die
And did the Sunshine face his way
What was His furthest mindOf Homeor God
Or what the Distant say
At news that He ceased Human Nature
Such a Day
And WishesHad He Any
Just His SighAccented
Had been legibleto Me
And was He Confident until
Ill fluttered outin Everlasting Well
And if He spokeWhat name was Best
What last
What One broke off with
At the Drowsiest
Was He afraidor tranquil
Might He know
How Conscious Consciousnesscould grow
Till Love that wasand Love too best to be
Meetand the Junction be Eternity
To learn the Transport by the Pain
As Blind Men learn the sun
To die of thirstsuspecting
That Brooks in Meadows run
To stay the homesickhomesick feet
Upon a foreign shore
Haunted by native lands the while
And bluebeloved air
This is the Sovereign Anguish
Thisthe signal woe
These are the patient Laureates
Whose voicestrainedbelow
As cend in ceaseless Carol
Inaudible indeed
To usthe duller scholars
Of the Mysterious Bard
To lose ones faithsurpass
The loss of an Estate
Because Estates can be
Replenishedfaith cannot
Inherited with Life
Beliefbut oncecan be
Annihilate a single clause
And BeingsBeggary
To lose thee sweeter than to gain
All other hearts I knew
Tis true the drought is destitute
But then I had the dew
The Caspian has its realms of sand
Its other realm of sea
Without this sterile perquisite
No Caspian could be
To love thee Year by Year
May less appear
Than sacrifice and cease
However dear
Forever might be short I thought to show
And so I pieced it with a flower now
To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee
One clover and a bee
And revery
The revery alone will do
If bees are few
To make Ones Toiletteafter Death
Has made the Toilette cool
Of only Taste we cared to please
Is difficult and still
Thats easierthan Braid the Hair
And make the Bodice gay
When eyes that fondled it are wrenched
By Decaloguesaway
To mend each tattered Faith
There is a needle fair
Though no appearance indicate
Tis threaded in the Air
And though it do not wear
As if it never Tore
Tis very comfortable indeed
And spacious as before
To my quick ear the leaves conferred
The bushes they were bells
I could not find a privacy
From Natures sentinels
In cave if I presumed to hide
The walls began to tell
Creation seemed a mighty crack
To make me visible
To my small Hearth His fire came
And all my House aglow
Did fan and rock with sudden light
Twas Sunrisetwas the Sky
Impanelled from no Summer brief
With limit of Decay
Twas Noonwithout the News of Night
Nay Nature it was Day
To offer brave assistance
To Lives that stand alone
When One has failed to stop them
Is Humanbut Divine
To lend an Ample Sinew
Unto a Nameless Man
Whose Homely Benediction
No otherstopped to earn
To One denied the drink
To tell what Water is
Would be acuter would it not
Than letting Him surmise
To lead Him to the Well
And let Him hear it drip
Remind Him would it not somewhat
Of His condemned lip
To own the Art within the Soul
The Soul to entertain
With Silence as a Company
And Festival maintain
Is an unfurnished Circumstance
Possession is to One
As an Estate perpetual
Or a reduceless Mine
To put this World down like a Bundle
And walk steady away
Requires Energypossibly Agony
Tis the Scarlet way
Trodden with straight renunciation
By the Son of God
Later his faint Confederates
Justify the Road
Flavors of that old Crucifixion
Filaments of Bloom Pontius Pilate sowed
Strong Clusters from Barabbas Tomb
Sacrament Saints partook before us
Patent every drop
With the Brand of the Gentile Drinker
Who indorsed the Cup
To see her is a Picture
To hear her is a Tune
To know her an Intemperance
As innocent as June
To know her not Affliction
To own her for a Friend
A warmth as near as if the Sun
Were shining in your Hand
To the bright east she flies
Brothers of Paradise
Remit her home
Without a change of wings
Or Loves convenient things
Enticed to come
Fashioning what she is
Fathoming what she was
We deem we dream
And that dissolves the days
Through which existence strays
Homeless at home
To this World she returned
But with a tinge of that
A Compound manner
As a Sod
Espoused a Violet
That chiefer to the Skies
Than to himself allied
Dwelt hesitating half of Dust
And half of Day the Bride
To venerate the simple days
Which lead the seasons by
Needs but to remember
That from you or I
They may take the trifle
Termed mortality
To wait an Houris long
If Love be just beyond
To wait Eternityis short
If Love reward the end
Tomorrow whose location
The Wise deceives
Though its hallucination
Is last that leaves
Tomorrow thou Retriever
Of every tare
Of Alibi art thou
Or ownest where
Too cold is this
To warm with Sun
Too stiff to bended be
To joint this Agate were a work
Outstaring Masonry
How went the Agile Kernel out
Contusion of the Husk
Nor Rip nor wrinkle indicate
But just an Asterisk
Too little way the House must lie
From every Human Heart
That holds in undisputed Lease
A white inhabitant
Too narrow is the Right between
Too imminent the chance
Each Consciousness must emigrate
And lose its neighbor once
I like to see it lap the miles
And lick the valleys up
And stop to feed itself at tanks
And then prodigious step
Around a pile of mountains
And supercilious peer
In shanties by the sides of roads
And then a quarry pare
To fit its sides and crawl between
Complaining all the while
In horrid hooting stanza
Then chase itself down the hill
And neigh like Boanerges
Then punctual as a star
Stop docile and omnipotent
At its own stable door
Triumphmay be of several kinds
Theres Triumph in the Room
When that Old ImperatorDeath
By Faith
Trust in the Unexpected
By thiswas William Kidd
Persuaded of the Buried Gold
As One had testified
Through thisthe old Philosopher
His Talismanic Stone
Discernédstill withholden
To effort undivine
Twas thisallured Columbus
When Genoawithdrew
Before an Apparition
Baptized America
The Sameafflicted Thomas
When Deity assured
Twas betterthe perceiving not
Provided it believed
Truthis as old as God
His Twin identity
And will endure as long as He
A CoEternity
And perish on the Day
Himself is borne away
From Mansion of the Universe
A lifeless Deity
Twas a long Partingbut the time
For Interviewhad Come
Before the Judgment Seat of God
The lastand second time
These Fleshless Lovers met
A Heaven in a Gaze
A Heaven of Heavensthe Privilege
Of one anothers Eyes
No Lifetimeon Them
Appareled as the new
Unbornexcept They had beheld
Born infiniternow
Was Bridaleer like This
A Paradisethe Host
And Cherubimand Seraphim
The unobtrusive Guest
Twas comfort in her Dying Room
To hear the living Clock
A short relief to have the wind
Walk boldly up and knock
Diversion from the Dying Theme
To hear the children play
But wrong the more
That these could live
And this of ours must die
Twas CrisisAll the length had passed
That dullbenumbing time
There is in Fever or Event
And now the Chance had come
The instant holding in its claw
The privilege to live
Or warrant to report the Soul
The other side the Grave
The Muscles grappled as with leads
That would not let the Will
The Spirit shook the Adamant
But could not make it feel
The Second poiseddebatedshot
Another had begun
And simultaneously a Soul
Escaped the House unseen
Twas just this time last year I died
I know I heard the Corn
When I was carried by the Farms
It had the Tassels on
I thought how yellow it would look
When Richard went to mill
And then I wanted to get out
But something held my will
I thought just how RedApples wedged
The Stubbles joints between
And the Carts stooping round the fields
To take the Pumpkins in
I wondered which would miss me least
And when Thanksgiving came
If Fatherd multiply the plates
To make an even Sum
And would it blur the Christmas glee
My Stocking hang too high
For any Santa Claus to reach
The Altitude of me
But this sort grieved myself
And so I thought the other way
How just this time some perfect year
Themself should come to me
Twas like a Maelstrom with a notch
That nearer every Day
Kept narrowing its boiling Wheel
Until the Agony
Toyed coolly with the final inch
Of your delirious Hem
And you dropt lost
When something broke
And let you from a Dream
As if a Goblin with a Gauge
Kept measuring the Hours
Until you felt your Second
Weigh helpless in his Paws
And not a Sinewstirredcould help
And sense was setting numb
When Godrememberedand the Fiend
Let go then Overcome
As if your Sentence stoodpronounced
And you were frozen led
From Dungeons luxury of Doubt
To Gibbets and the Dead
And when the Film had stitched your eyes
A Creature gasped Reprieve
Which Anguish was the utterestthen
To perish or to live
Twas Lovenot me
Oh punishpray
The Real one died for Thee
Just Himnot me
Such Guiltto love Theemost
Doom it beyond the Rest
Forgive itlast
Twas base as Jesusmost
Let Justice not mistake
We Twolooked so alike
Which was the Guilty Sake
Twas LovesNow Strike
Twas such a littlelittle boat
That toddled down the bay
Twas such a gallantgallant sea
That beckoned it away
Twas such a greedy greedy wave
That licked it from the Coast
Nor ever guessed the stately sails
My little craft was lost
Twas the oldroadthrough pain
That unfrequentedone
With many a turnand thorn
That stopsat Heaven
Thiswas the Townshe passed
Therewhere sherestedlast
Thenstepped more fast
The little tracksclose prest
Thennot so swift
Slowslowas feet did wearygrow
Thenstoppedno other track
Wait Look Her little Book
The leafat loveturned back
Her very Hat
And this worn shoe just fits the track
Herselfthoughfled
Another beda short one
Women maketonight
In Chambers bright
Too out of sightthough
For our hoarse Good Night
To touch her Head
Twas warmat firstlike Us
Until there crept upon
A Chilllike frost upon a Glass
Till all the scenebe gone
The Forehead copied Stone
The Fingers grew too cold
To acheand like a Skaters Brook
The busy eyescongealed
It straightenedthat was all
It crowded Cold to Cold
It multiplied indifference
As Pride were all it could
And even when with Cords
Twas lowered like a Weight
It made no Signal nor demurred
But dropped like Adamant
Twice had Summer her fair Verdure
Proffered to the Plain
Twice a Winters silver Fracture
On the Rivers been
Two full Autumns for the Squirrel
Bounteous prepared
Nature Hadst thou not a Berry
For thy wandering Bird
Two butterflies went out at noon
And waltzed above a stream
Then stepped straight through the firmament
And rested on a beam
And then together bore away
Upon a shining sea
Though never yet in any port
Their coming mentioned be
If spoken by the distant bird
If met in ether sea
By frigate or by merchantman
Report was not to me
Two swimmers wrestled on the spar
Until the morning sun
When Oneturned smiling to the land
Oh God the Other One
The stray shipspassing
Spied a face
Upon the waters borne
With eyes in deathstill begging raised
And handsbeseechingthrown
Two Travellers perishing in Snow
The Forests as they froze
Together heard them strengthening
Each other with the words
That Heaven if Heavenmust contain
What Either left behind
And then the cheer too solemn grew
For language and the wind
Long steps across the features took
That Love had touched the Morn
With reverential Hyacinth
The taleless Days went on
Till Mystery impatient drew
And those They left behind
Led absent were procured of Heaven
As Those first furnished said
Twowere immortal twice
The privilege of few
Eternityobtainedin Time
Reversed Divinity
That our ignoble Eyes
The quality conceive
Of Paradise superlative
Through their Comparative
Twould easea Butterfly
Elatea Bee
Thourt neither
Neitherthy capacity
But Blossom were I
I would rather be
Thy moment
Than a Bees Eternity
Content of fading
Is enough for me
Fade I unto Divinity
And DyingLifetime
Ample as the Eye
Her least attention raise on me
Unable are the Loved to die
For Love is Immortality
Nay it is Deity
Unable they that loveto die
For Love reforms Vitality
Into Divinity
Uncertain leasedevelops lustre
On Time
Uncertain Grasp appreciation
Of Sum
The shorter Fateis oftener the chiefest
Because
Inheritors upon a tenure
Prize
Under the Light yet under
Under the Grass and the Dirt
Under the Beetles Cellar
Under the Clovers Root
Further than Arm could stretch
Were it Giant long
Further than Sunshine could
Were the Day Year long
Over the Light yet over
Over the Arc of the Bird
Over the Comets chimney
Over the Cubits Head
Further than Guess can gallop
Further than Riddle ride
Oh for a Disc to the Distance
Between Ourselves and the Dead
Undue Significance a starving man attaches

Than Lifes sweet Calculations
The mixing Bells and Palls

To Ears the Dying Side
Tis Coronaland Funeral
Salutingin the Road
Victory comes late
And is held low to freezing lips
Too rapt with frost
To take it
How sweet it would have tasted
Just a Drop
Was God so economical
His Tables spread too high for Us
Unless We dine on tiptoe
Crumbsfit such little mouths
Cherriessuit Robbins
The Eagles Golden Breakfast stranglesThem
God keep His Oath to Sparrows
Who of little Loveknow how to starve
Volcanoes be in Sicily
And South America
I judge from my Geography
Volcanos nearer here
A Lava step at any time
Am I inclined to climb
A Crater I may contemplate
Vesuvius at Home
Wait till the Majesty of Death
Invests so mean a brow
Almost a powdered Footman
Might dare to touch it now
Wait till in Everlasting Robes
That Democrat is dressed
Then prate about Preferment
And Station and the rest
Around this quiet Courtier
Obsequious Angels wait
Full royal is his Retinue
Full purple is his state
A Lord might dare to lift the Hat
To such a Modest Clay
Since that My Lord the Lord of Lords
Receives unblushingly
Warm in her Hand these accents lie
While faithful and afar
The Grace so awkward for her sake
Its fond subjection wear
Water is taught by thirst
Landby the Oceans passed
Transportby throe
Peaceby its battles told
Love by Memorial Mold
Birds by the Snow
Water makes many Beds
For those averse to sleep
Its awful chamber open stands
Its Curtains blandly sweep
Abhorrent is the Rest
In undulating Rooms
Whose Amplitude no end invades
Whose Axis never comes
WeBee and Ilive by the quaffing
Tisnt all Hockwith us
Life has its Ale
But its many a lay of the Dim Burgundy
We chantfor cheerwhen the Winesfail
Do we get drunk
Ask the jolly Clovers
Do we beat our Wife
Inever wed
Beepledges hisin minute flagons
Daintyas the treeson our deft Head
While runs the Rhine

Found deadof Nectar
By a humming Coroner
In a ByThyme
We can but follow to the Sun
As oft as He go down
He leave Ourselves a Sphere behind
Tis mostlyfollowing
We go no further with the Dust
Than to the Earthen Door
And then the Panels are reversed
And we beholdno more
We Cover TheeSweet Face
Not that We tire of Thee
But that Thyself fatigue of Us
Rememberas Thou go
We follow Thee until
Thou notice Usno more
And thenreluctantturn away
To Con Thee oer and oer
And blame the scanty love
We were Content to show
AugmentedSweeta Hundred fold
If Thou wouldst take itnow
We do not play on Graves
Because there isnt Room
Besidesit isnt evenit slants
And People come
And put a Flower on it
And hang their faces so
Were fearing that their Hearts will drop
And crush our pretty play
And so we move as far
As Enemiesaway
Just looking round to see how far
It isOccasionally
We dont cryTim and I
We are far too grand
But we bolt the door tight
To prevent a friend
Then we hide our brave face
Deep in our hand
Not to cryTim and I
We are far too grand
Nor to dreamhe and me
Do we condescend
We just shut our brown eye
To see to the end
Timsee Cottages
But Oh so high
Thenwe shakeTim and I
And lest Icry
Timreads a little Hymn
And we both pray
Please Sir I and Tim
Always lost the way
We must dieby and by

ITimand Me
We dreamit is good we are dreaming
It would hurt uswere we awake
But since it is playingkill us
And we are playingshriek
What harm Men dieexternally
It is a truthof Blood
But weare dying in Drama
And Dramais never dead
CautiousWe jar each other
And eitheropen the eyes
Lest the Phantasmprove the Mistake
And the livid Surprise
Cool us to Shafts of Granite
With just an Ageand Name
And perhaps a phrase in Egyptian
Its prudenterto dream
We grow accustomed to the Dark
When light is put away
As when the Neighbor holds the Lamp
To witness her Goodbye
A Moment We uncertain step
For newness of the night
Then fit our Vision to the Dark
And meet the Road erect
And so of larger Darknesses
Those Evenings of the Brain
When not a Moon disclose a sign
Or Star come out within
The Bravest grope a little
And sometimes hit a Tree
Directly in the Forehead
But as they learn to see
Either the Darkness alters
Or something in the sight
Adjusts itself to Midnight
And Life steps almost straight
We learned the Whole of Love
The Alphabetthe Words
A Chapterthen the mighty Book
ThenRevelation closed
But in Each Others eyes
An Ignorance beheld
Diviner than the Childhoods
And each to each a Child
Attempted to expound
What Neitherunderstood
Alas that Wisdom is so large
And Truthso manifold
We like March his shoes are purple
He is new and high
Makes he mud for dog and peddler
Makes he forest dry
Knows the adders tongue his coming
And begets her spot
Stands the sun so close and mighty
That our minds are hot
News is he of all the others
Bold it were to die
With the bluebirds buccaneering
On his British sky
We losebecause we win
Gamblersrecollecting which
Toss their dice again
We met as SparksDiverging Flints
Sent variousscattered ways
We parted as the Central Flint
Were cloven with an Adze
Subsisting on the Light We bore
Before We felt the Dark
A Flint unto this Dayperhaps
But for that single Spark
We miss Her not because We see
The Absence of an Eye
Except its Mind accompany
Abridge Society
As slightly as the Routes of Stars
Ourselvesasleep below
We know that their superior Eyes
Include Usas they go
We outgrow love like other things
And put it in the Drawer
Till it an Antique fashion shows
Like Costumes Grandsires wore
We play at paste
Till qualified for pearl
Then drop the paste
And deem ourself a fool
The shapes though were similar
And our new hands
Learned gemtactics
Practising sands
We prayto Heaven
We prateof Heaven
Relatewhen Neighbors die
At what oclock to heaventhey fled
Who saw themWherefore fly

We could not grasp its segment

Our Apenninea Knoll
Perhaps tis kindlydone us
The Anguishand the loss

The Thing belonged to us
To spare these Striding Spirits
Some Morning of Chagrin
The waking in a Gnatsembrace
Our Giantsfurther on
We should not mind so small a flower
Except it quiet bring
Our little garden that we lost
Back to the Lawn again
So spicy her Carnations nod
So drunken reel her Bees
So silver steal a hundred flutes
From out a hundred trees
That whoso sees this little flower
By faith may clear behold
The Bobolinks around the throne
And Dandelions gold
We talked as Girls do
Fond and late
We speculated fair on every subject but the Grave
Of ours none affair
We handled Destinies as cool
As weDisposersbe
And God a Quiet Party
To our Authority
But fondest dwelt upon Ourself
As we eventualbe
When Girls to Women softly raised

We parted with a contract
To cherish and to write
But Heaven made both impossible
Before another night
We thirst at firsttis Natures Act
And laterwhen we die
A little Water supplicate
Of fingers going by
It intimates the finer want
Whose adequate supply
Is that Great Water in the West
Termed Immortality
Went up a year this evening
I recollect it well
Amid no bells nor bravoes
The bystanders will tell
Cheerfulas to the village
Tranquilas to repose
Chastenedas to the Chapel
This humble Tourist rose
Did not talk of returning
Alluded to no time
When were the gales propitious
We might look for him
Was grateful for the Roses
In lifes diverse bouquet
Talked softly of new species
To pick another day
Beguiling thus the wonder
The wondrous nearer drew
Hands bustled at the moorings
The crown respectful grew
Ascended from our vision
To Countenances new
A DifferenceA Daisy

What care the Dead for Chanticleer
What care the Dead for Day
Tis late your Sunrise vex their face
And Purple Ribaldryof Morning
Pour as blank on them
As on the Tier of Wall
The Mason builded yesterday
And equally as cool
What care the Dead for Summer
The Solstice had no Sun
Could waste the Snow before their Gate
And knew One Bird a Tune
Could thrill their Mortised Ear
Of all the Birds that be
This Onebeloved of Mankind
Henceforward cherished be
What care the Dead for Winter
Themselves as easy freeze
June Noonas January Night
As soon the Southher Breeze
Of Sycamoreor Cinnamon
Deposit in a Stone
And put a Stone to keep it Warm
Give Spicesunto Men
What did They do since I saw Them
Were They industrious
So many questions to put Them
Have I the eagerness
That could I snatch Their Faces
That could Their lips reply
Not till the last was answered
Should They start for the Sky
Not if Their Party were waiting
Not if to talk with Me
Were to Them now Homesickness
After Eternity
Not if the Just suspect me
And offer a Reward
Would I restore my Booty
To that Bold Person God
What I see not I better see
Through Faithmy Hazel Eye
Has periods of shutting
But No lid has Memory
For frequent all my sense obscured
I equally behold
As someone held a light unto
The Features so beloved
And I ariseand in my Dream
Do Thee distinguished Grace
Till jealous Daylight interrupt
And mar thy perfectness
What if I say I shall not wait
What if I burst the fleshly Gate
And pass escapedto thee
What if I file this Mortaloff
See where it hurt meThats enough
And wade in Liberty
They cannot take meany more
Dungeons can calland Guns implore
Unmeaningnowto me
As laughterwasan hour ago
Or Lacesor a Travelling Show
Or who diedyesterday
What Inn is this
Where for the night
Peculiar Traveller comes
Who is the Landlord
Where the maids
Behold what curious rooms
No ruddy fires on the hearth
No brimming Tankards flow

Who are these below
What isParadise
Who live there
Are they Farmers
Do they hoe
Do they know that this is Amherst
And that Iam comingtoo
Do they wear new shoesin Eden

Wont they scold uswhen were homesick
Or tell Godhow cross we are
You are sure theres such a person
As a Fatherin the sky
So if I get lostthereever
Or do what the Nurse calls die
I shant walk the Jasperbarefoot
Ransomed folkswont laugh at me

As New England used to be
What shall I doit whimpers so
This little Hound within the Heart
All day and night with bark and start
And yet it will not go
Would you untie it were you me
Would it stop whiningif to Thee
I sent iteven now
It should not tease you
By your chairor on the mat
Or if it dareto climb your dizzy knee
Orsometimes at your side to run
When you were willing
Shall it come
Tell Carlo
Hell tell me
What shall I do when the Summer troubles
What when the Rose is ripe
What when the Eggs fly off in Music
From the Maple Keep
What shall I do when the Skies achirrup
Drop a Tune on me
When the Bee hangs all Noon in the Buttercup
What will become of me
Oh when the Squirrel fills His Pockets
And the Berries stare
How can I bear their jocund Faces
Thou from Here so far
Twouldnt afflict a Robin
All His Goods have Wings

When I count the seeds
That are sown beneath
To bloom so bye and bye
When I con the people
Lain so low
To be received as high
When I believe the garden
Mortal shall not see
Pick by faith its blossom
And avoid its Bee
I can spare this summer unreluctantly
When I have seen the Sun emerge
From His amazing House
And leave a Day at every Door
A Deed in every place
Without the incident of Fame
Or accident of Noise
The Earth has seemed to me a Drum
Pursued of little Boys
When I hoped I recollect
Just the place I stood
At a Window facing West
Roughest Airwas good
Not a Sleet could bite me
Not a frost could cool
Hope it was that kept me warm
Not Merino shawl
When I fearedI recollect
Just the Day it was
Worlds were lying out to Sun
Yet how Nature froze
Icicles upon my soul
Prickled Blue and Cool
Bird went praising everywhere
Only Mewas still
And the Day that I despaired
Thisif I forget
Nature willthat it be Night
After Sun has set
Darkness intersect her face
And put out her eye
Nature hesitatebefore
Memory and I
When I was small a Woman died
Todayher Only Boy
Went up from the Potomac
His face all Victory
To look at herHow slowly
The Seasons must have turned
Till Bullets clipt an Angle
And He passed quickly round
If pride shall be in Paradise
Ourself cannot decide
Of their imperial Conduct
No person testified
But proud in Apparition
That Woman and her Boy
Pass back and forth before my Brain
As even in the sky
Im confident that Bravoes
Perpetual break abroad
For Braveries remote as this
In Scarlet Maryland
When Katie walks this simple pair accompany her side
When Katie runs unwearied they follow on the road
When Katie kneels their loving hands still clasp her pious knee
Ah Katie Smile at Fortune with two so knit to thee
When Memory is full
Put on the perfect Lid
This Mornings finest syllable
Presumptuous Evening said
When Night is almost done
And Sunrise grows so near
That we can touch the Spaces
Its time to smooth the Hair
And get the Dimples ready
And wonder we could care
For that oldfaded Midnight
That frightenedbut an Hour
When One has given up Ones life
The parting with the rest
Feels easy as when Day lets go
Entirely the West
The Peaks that lingered last
Remain in Her regret
As scarcely as the Iodine
Upon the Cataract
When Roses cease to bloom Sir
And Violets are done
When Bumblebees in solemn flight
Have passed beyond the Sun
The hand that paused to gather
Upon this Summers day
Will idle liein Auburn
Then take my flowerspray
When the Astronomer stops seeking
For his Pleiads Face
When the lone British Lady
Forsakes the Arctic Race
When to his Covenant Needle
The Sailor doubting turns
It will be amply early
To ask what treason means
When we stand on the tops of Things
And like the Trees look down
The smoke all cleared away from it
And Mirrors on the scene
Just laying lightno soul will wink
Except it have the flaw
The Sound ones like the Hillsshall stand
No Lighting scares away
The Perfect nowhere be afraid
They bear their dauntless Heads
Where others dare not go at Noon
Protected by their deeds
The Stars dare shine occasionally
Upon a spotted World
And Suns go surer for their Proof
As if an Axle held
Where bells no more affright the morn
Where scrabble never comes
Where very nimble Gentlemen
Are forced to keep their rooms
Where tired Children placid sleep
Thro Centuries of noon
This place is Blissthis town is Heaven
Please Pater pretty soon
Oh could we climb where Moses stood
And view the Landscape oer
Not Fathers bellsnor Factories
Could scare us any more
Where I have lost I softer tread
I sow sweet flower from garden bed
I pause above that vanished head
And mourn
Whom I have lost I pious guard
From accent harsh or ruthless word
Feeling as if their pillow heard
Though stone
When I have lost youll know by this
A Bonnet blackA dusk surplice
A little tremor in my voice
Like this
Why I have lost the people know
Who dressed in flocks of purest snow
Went home a century ago
Next Bliss
Where Ships of Purplegently toss
On Seas of Daffodil
Fantastic Sailorsmingle
And thenthe Wharf is still
Where Thou artthatis Home
Cashmereor Calvarythe same
Degreeor Shame
I scarce esteem Locations Name
So I may Come
What Thou dostis Delight
Bondage as Playbe sweet
ImprisonmentContent
And SentenceSacrament
Just We twomeet
Where Thou art notis Woe
Tho Bands of Spicesrow
What Thou dost notDespair
Tho Gabrielpraise meSire
Whether my bark went down at sea
Whether she met with gales
Whether to isles enchanted
She bent her docile sails
By what mystic mooring
She is held today
This is the errand of the eye
Out upon the Bay
Whether they have forgotten
Or are forgetting now
Or never remembered
Safer not to know
Miseries of conjecture
Are a softer woe
Than a Fact of Iron
Hardened with I know
While Asters
On the Hill
Their Everlasting fashionsset
And Covenant GentiansFrill
While it is alive
Until Death touches it
While it and I lap one Air
Dwell in one Blood
Under one Sacrament
Show me Division can split or pare
Love is like Lifemerely longer
Love is like Death during the Grave
Love is the Fellow of the Resurrection
Scooping up the Dust and chanting Live
Who Court obtain within Himself
Sees every Man a King
And Poverty of Monarchy
Is an interior thing
No Man depose
Whom Fate Ordain
And Who can add a Crown
To Him who doth continual
Conspire against His Own
Who Giants know with lesser Men
Are incomplete and shy
For Greatness that is ill at ease
In minor Company
A Smaller could not be perturbed
The Summer Gnat displays
Unconscious that his single Fleet
Do not comprise the skies
Who never lost are unprepared
A Coronet to find
Who never thirsted
Flagons and Cooling Tamarind
Who never climbed the weary league
Can such a foot explore
The purple territories
On Pizarros shore
How many Legions overcome
The Emperor will say
How many Colors taken
On Revolution Day
How many Bullets bearest
Hast Thou the Royal scar
Angels Write Promoted
On this Soldiers brow
Who occupies this House
A Stranger I must judge
Since No one know His Circumstance
Tis well the name and age
Are writ upon the Door
Or I should fear to pause
Where not so much as Honest Dog
Approach encourages
It seems a curious Town
Some Houses very old
Somenewly raised this Afternoon
Were I compelled to build
It should not be among
Inhabitants so still
But where the Birds assemble
And Boys were possible
Before Myself was born
Twas settled so they say
A Territory for the Ghosts
And Squirrels formerly
Until a Pioneer as
Settlers often do
Liking the quiet of the Place
Attracted more unto
And from a Settlement
A Capital has grown
Distinguished for the gravity
Of every Citizen
The Owner of this House
A Stranger He must be
Eternitys Acquaintances
Are mostly soto me
Who were the Father and the Son
We pondered when a child
And what had they to do with us
And when portentous told
With inference appalling
By Childhood fortified
We thought at least they are no worse
Than they have been described
Who are the Father and the Son
Did we demand Today
The Father and the Son himself
Would doubtless specify
But had they the felicity
When we desired to know
We better Friends had been perhaps
Than time ensue to be
We start to learn that we believe
But once entirely
Belief it does not fit so well
When altered frequently
We blush that Heaven if we achieve
Event ineffable
We shall have shunned until ashamed
To own the Miracle
Whole Gulfs of Red and Fleets of Red
And Crews of solid Blood
Did place upon the West Tonight
As twere specific Ground
And They appointed Creatures
In Authorized Arrays
Due promptly as a Drama
That bows and disappears
Whose are the little beds I asked
Which in the valleys lie
Some shook their heads and others smiled
And no one made reply
Perhaps they did not hear I said
I will inquire again
Whose are the bedsthe tiny beds
So thick upon the plain
Tis Daisy in the shortest
A little further on
Nearest the doorto wake the Ist
Little Leontoden
Tis Iris Sir and Aster
Anemone and Bell
Bartsia in the blanket red
And chubby Daffodil
Meanwhile at many cradles
Her busy foot she plied
Humming the quaintest lullaby
That ever rocked a child
Hush Epigea wakens
The Crocus stirs her lids
Rhodoras cheek is crimson
Shes dreaming of the woods
Then turning from them reverent
Their bedtime tis she said
The Bumble bees will wake them
When April woods are red
Whose cheek is this
What rosy face
Has lost a blush today
I found herpleiadin the woods
And bore her safe away
Robins in the tradition
Did cover such with leaves
But which the cheek
And which the pall
My scrutiny deceives
Whose Pink career may have a close
Portentous as our own who knows
To imitate these Neighbors fleet
In awe and innocence were meet
Why do I love You Sir
Because
The Wind does not require the Grass
To answerWherefore when He pass
She cannot keep Her place
Because He knowsand
Do not You
And We know not
Enough for Us
The Wisdom it be so
The Lightningnever asked an Eye
Wherefore it shutwhen He was by
Because He knows it cannot speak
And reasons not contained
Of Talk

Whydo they shut Me out of Heaven
Did I singtoo loud
ButI can say a little Minor
Timid as a Bird
Wouldnt the Angels try me
Justoncemore
Justseeif I troubled them
But dontshut the door
Oh if Iwere the Gentleman
In the White Robe
And theywere the little Handthat knocked
CouldIforbid
Why make it doubtit hurts it so
So sickto guess
So strongto know
So braveupon its little Bed
To tell the very last They said
Unto Itselfand smileAnd shake
For that deardistantdangerousSake
Butthe Insteadthe Pinching fear
That Somethingit did door dare
Offend the Visionand it flee
And They no more remember me
Nor ever turn to tell me why
Oh Master This is Misery
Wild Nights Wild Nights
Were I with thee
Wild Nights should be
Our luxury
Futile the winds
To a heart in port
Done with the compass
Done with the chart
Rowing in Eden
Ah the sea
Might I but moor
Tonight in Thee
Will there really be a Morning
Is there such a thing as Day
Could I see it from the mountains
If I were as tall as they
Has it feet like Water lilies
Has it feathers like a Bird
Is it brought from famous countries
Of which I have never heard
Oh some Scholar Oh some Sailor
Oh some Wise Men from the skies
Please to tell a little Pilgrim
Where the place called Morning lies
Witchcraft has not a pedigree
‘Tis early as our breath
And mourners meet it going out
The moment of our death
Twas such a little little boat
That toddled down the bay
Twas such a gallant gallant sea
That beckoned it away
Twas such a greedy greedy wave
That licked it from the Coast
Nor ever guessed the stately sails
My little craft was lost
I hide myself within my flower
That wearing on your breast
You unsuspecting wear me too
And angels know the rest
I hide myself within my flower
That fading from your vase
You unsuspecting feel for me
Almost a loneliness
With thee in the Desert
With thee in the thirst
With thee in the Tamarind wood
Leopard breathesat last
Within my Garden rides a Bird
Upon a single Wheel
Whose spokes a dizzy Music make
As twere a travelling Mill
He never stops but slackens
Above the Ripest Rose
Partakes without alighting
And praises as he goes
Till every spice is tasted
And then his Fairy Gig
Reels in remoter atmospheres
And I rejoin my Dog
And He and I perplex us
If positive twere we
Or bore the Garden in the Brain
This Curiosity
But He the best Logician
Refers my clumsy eye
To just vibrating Blossoms
An Exquisite Reply
Within my reach
I could have touched
I might have chanced that way
Soft sauntered thro the village
Sauntered as soft away
So unsuspected Violets
Within the meadows go
Too late for striving fingers
That passed an hour ago
Without thisthere is nought
All other Riches be
As is the Twitter of a Bird
Heard opposite the Sea
I could not careto gain
A lesser than the Whole
For did not this include themself
As Seamsinclude the Ball
I wished a way might be
My Heart to subdivide
Twould magnifythe Gratitude
And not reducethe Gold
Wolfe demanded during dying
Which obtain the Day

Would you like summer Taste of ours
Spices Buy here
Ill We have berries for the parching
Weary Furloughs of down
Perplexed Estates of violet trouble neer looked on
Captive We bring reprieve of roses
Fainting Flasks of air
Even for Death a fairy medicine
But which is it sir
Yesterday is History
Tis so far away
Yesterday is Poetry
Tis Philosophy
Yesterday is mystery
Where it is Today
While we shrewdly speculate
Flutter both away
You cannot put a Fire out
A Thing that can ignite
Can go itself without a Fan
Upon the slowest Night
You cannot fold a Flood
And put it in a Drawer
Because the Winds would find it out
And tell your Cedar Floor
You constituted Time
I deemed Eternity
A Revelation of Yourself
Twas therefore Deity

Youll findit when you try to die
The Easier to let go
For recollecting such as went
You could not spareyou know
And though their places somewhat filled
As did their Marble names
With Mossthey never grew so full
You chose the newer names
And when this Worldsets further back
As Dyingsay it does
The former lovedistincter grows
And supersedes the fresh
And Thought of themso fair invites
It looks too tawdry Grace
To stay behindwith just the Toys
We boughtto ease their place
Youll know Herby Her Foot
The smallest Gamboge Hand
With Fingerswhere the Toes should be
Would more affront the Sand
Than this Quaint Creatures Boot
Adjusted by a Stern
Without a ButtonI could vouch
Unto a Velvet Limb
Youll know Herby Her Vest
Tight fittingOrangeBrown
Inside a Jacket duller
She wore when she was born
Her Cap is smalland snug
Constructed for the Winds
Shed pass for Bareheadshort way off
But as She Closer stands
So finer tis than Wool
You cannot feel the Seam
Nor is it Clasped unto of Band
Nor held uponof Brim
Youll know Herby Her Voice
At firsta doubtful Tone
A sweet endeavorbut as March
To Aprilhurries on
She squanders on your Ear
Such Arguments of Pearl
You beg the Robin in your Brain
To keep the otherstill
Youll know itas you know tis Noon
By Glory
As you do the Sun
By Glory
As you will in Heaven
Know God the Fatherand the Son
By intuition Mightiest Things
Assert themselvesand not by terms
Im Midnightneed the Midnight say
Im SunriseNeed the Majesty
Omnipotencehad not a Tongue
His listpis Lightningand the Sun
His Conversationwith the Sea
How shall you know
Consult your Eye
You love meyou are sure
I shall not fear mistake
I shall not cheated wake
Some grinning morn
To find the Sunrise left
And Orchardsunbereft
And Dolliegone
I need not startyoure sure
That night will never be
When frightenedhome to Thee I run
To find the windows dark
And no more Dolliemark
Quite none
Be sure youre sureyou know
Ill bear it better now
If youll just tell me so
Than whena little dull Balm grown
Over this pain of mine
You stingagain
You love the Lordyou cannot see
You write Himevery day
A little notewhen you awake
And further in the Day
An Ample LetterHow you miss
And would delight to see
But then His Houseis but a Step
And Minesin HeavenYou see
Youre rightthe way is narrow
And difficult the Gate
And few there beCorrect again
That enter inthereat

Tis just the price of Breath
With but the Discount of the Grave

And after thattheres Heaven

Then Great it beif that please Thee
Or Smallor any size at all

How many times it ache for metodayConfess
How many times for my far sake

But I guess guessing hurts
Minegot so dim
Too vaguethe face
My ownso patientcovers
Too farthe strength
My timidness enfolds
Haunting the Heart
Like her translated faces
Teasing the want
Itonlycan suffice
You taught me Waiting with Myself
Appointment strictly kept
You taught me fortitude of Fate
ThisalsoI have learnt
An Altitude of Death that could
No bitterer debar
Than Lifehad donebefore it
Yetthere is a Science more
The Heaven you knowto understand
That you be not ashamed
Of Mein Christs bright Audience
Upon the further Hand
Your Richestaught mePoverty
Myselfa Millionaire
In little Wealths as Girls could boast
Till broad as Buenos Ayre
You drifted your Dominions
A Different Peru
And I esteemed All Poverty
For Lifes Estate with you
Of Mines I little knowmyself
But just the names of Gems
The Colors of the Commonest
And scarce of Diadems
So much that did I meet the Queen
Her Glory I should know
But this must be a different Wealth
To miss itbeggars so
Im sure tis Indiaall Day
To those who look on You
Without a stintwithout a blame
Might Ibut be the Jew
Im sure it is Golconda
Beyond my power to deem
To have a smile for Mineeach Day
How better than a Gem
At least it solaces to know
That there existsa Gold
Altho I prove it just in time
Its distanceto behold
Its farfar Treasure to surmise
And estimate the Pearl
That slipped my simple fingers through
While just a Girl at School
