Ourselves were wed one summer듟ear
Your Vision등as in June
And when Your little Lifetime failed
I wearied듮oo듪f mine
And overtaken in the Dark
Where You had put me down
By Some one carrying a Light
I듮ooreceived the Sign
'Tis true듎ur Futures different lay
Your Cottage듡aced the sun
While Oceans드nd the North must be
On every side of mine
'Tis true Your Garden led the Bloom
For mine들n Frosts등as sown
And yet one Summer we were Queens
But You등ere crowned in June
