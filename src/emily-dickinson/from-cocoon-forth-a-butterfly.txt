From Cocoon forth a Butterfly
As Lady from her Door
Emerged드 Summer Afternoon
Repairing Everywhere
Without Design듮hat I could trace
Except to stray abroad
On Miscellaneous Enterprise
The Clovers듯nderstood
Her pretty Parasol be seen
Contracting in a Field
Where Men made Hay
Then struggling hard
With an opposing Cloud
Where Parties듏hantom as Herself
To Nowhere듭eemed to go
In purposeless Circumference
As 'twere a Tropic Show
And notwithstanding Bee듮hat worked
And Flower듮hat zealous blew
This Audience of Idleness
Disdained them from the Sky
Till Sundown crept드 steady Tide
And Men that made the Hay
And Afternoon드nd Butterfly
Extinguished들n the Sea
