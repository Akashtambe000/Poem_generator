It's coming듮he postponeless Creature
It gains the Block드nd now들t gains the Door
Chooses its latch from all the other fastenings
Enters등ith a "You know Me듑ir"
Simple Salute드nd certain Recognition
Bold등ere it Enemy듁rief등ere it friend
Dresses each House in Crape and Icicle
And carries one듪ut of it듮o God
