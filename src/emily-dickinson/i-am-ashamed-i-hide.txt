I am ashamed듈 hide
What right have I듮o be a Bride
So late a Dowerless Girl
Nowhere to hide my dazzled Face
No one to teach me that new Grace
Nor introduce듨y Soul
Me to adorn듇ow듮ell
Trinket듮o make Me beautiful
Fabrics of Cashmere
Never a Gown of Dun듨ore
Raiment instead듪f Pompadour
For Me듌y soul듮o wear
Fingers듮o frame my Round Hair
Oval드s Feudal Ladies wore
Far Fashions듅air
Skill to hold my Brow like an Earl
Plead듧ike a Whippoorwill
Prove듧ike a Pearl
Then for Character
Fashion My Spirit quaint등hite
Quick듧ike a Liquor
Gay듧ike Light
Bring Me my best Pride
No more ashamed
No more to hide
Meek듧et it be듮oo proud듡or Pride
Baptized듮his Day드 Bride
