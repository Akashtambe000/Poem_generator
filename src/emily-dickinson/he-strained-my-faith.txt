He strained my faith
Did he find it supple
Shook my strong trust
Did it then듳ield
Hurled my belief
But듟id he shatter들t
Racked등ith suspense
Not a nerve failed
Wrung me등ith Anguish
But I never doubted him
'Tho' for what wrong
He did never say
Stabbed등hile I sued
His sweet forgiveness
Jesus들t's your little "John"
Don't you know듨e
