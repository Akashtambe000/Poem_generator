More Life등ent out등hen He went
Than Ordinary Breath
Lit with a finer Phosphor
Requiring in the Quench
A Power of Renowned Cold
The Climate of the Grave
A Temperature just adequate
So Anthracite to live
For some드n Ampler Zero
A Frost more needle keen
Is necessary to reduce
The Ethiop within
Others든xtinguish easier
A Gnat's minutest Fan
Sufficient to obliterate
A Tract of Citizen
Whose Peat lift드mply vivid
Ignores the solemn News
That Popocatapel exists
Or Etna's Scarlets Choose
