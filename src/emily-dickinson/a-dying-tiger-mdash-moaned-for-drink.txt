A Dying Tiger듨oaned for Drink
I hunted all the Sand
I caught the Dripping of a Rock
And bore it in my Hand
His Mighty Balls들n death were thick
But searching듈 could see
A Vision on the Retina
Of Water드nd of me
'Twas not my blame등ho sped too slow
'Twas not his blame등ho died
While I was reaching him
But 'twas듮he fact that He was dead
