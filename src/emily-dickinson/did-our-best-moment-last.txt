Did Our Best Moment last
'Twould supersede the Heaven
A few드nd they by Risk듫rocure
So this Sort드re not given
Except as stimulants들n
Cases of Despair
Or Stupor듒he Reserve
These Heavenly Moments are
A Grant of the Divine
That Certain as it Comes
Withdraws드nd leaves the dazzled Soul
In her unfurnished Rooms
