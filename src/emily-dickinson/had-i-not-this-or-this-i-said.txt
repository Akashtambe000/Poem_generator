Had I not This or This I said
Appealing to Myself
In moment of prosperity
Inadequate등ere Life
"Thou hast not Me nor Me"들t said
In Moment of Reverse
"And yet Thou art industrious
No need듣adst Thou듪f us"
My need등as all I had듈 said
The need did not reduce
Because the food든xterminate
The hunger듟oes not cease
But diligence들s sharper
Proportioned to the Chance
To feed upon the Retrograde
Enfeebles듮he Advance
