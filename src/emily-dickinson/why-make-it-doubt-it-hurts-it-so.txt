Why make it doubt들t hurts it so
So sick듮o guess
So strong듮o know
So brave듯pon its little Bed
To tell the very last They said
Unto Itself드nd smile듀nd shake
For that dear듟istant듟angerous듑ake
But듮he Instead듮he Pinching fear
That Something들t did do듪r dare
Offend the Vision드nd it flee
And They no more remember me
Nor ever turn to tell me why
Oh Master This is Misery
