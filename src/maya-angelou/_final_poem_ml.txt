We this people on a small and lonely planet
Traveling through casual space
Past aloof stars across the way of indifferent suns
To a destination where all signs tell us
It is possible and imperative that we learn
A brave and startling truth
And when we come to it
To the day of peacemaking
When we release our fingers
From fists of hostility
And allow the pure air to cool our palms
When we come to it
When the curtain falls on the minstrel show of hate
And faces sooted with scorn are scrubbed clean
When battlefields and coliseum
No longer rake our unique and particular sons and daughters
Up with the bruised and bloody grass
To lie in identical plots in foreign soil
When the rapacious storming of the churches
The screaming racket in the temples have ceased
When the pennants are waving gaily
When the banners of the world tremble
Stoutly in the good clean breeze
When we come to it
When we let the rifles fall from our shoulders
And children dress their dolls in flags of truce
When land mines of death have been removed
And the aged can walk into evenings of peace
When religious ritual is not perfumed
By the incense of burning flesh
And childhood dreams are not kicked awake
By nightmares of abuse
When we come to it
Then we will confess that not the Pyramids
With their stones set in mysterious perfection
Nor the Gardens of Babylon
Hanging as eternal beauty
In our collective memory
Not the Grand Canyon
Kindled into delicious color
By Western sunsets
Nor the Danube flowing its blue soul into Europe
Not the sacred peak of Mount Fuji
Stretching to the Rising Sun
Neither Father Amazon nor Mother Mississippi who without favor
Nurture all creatures in the depths and on the shores
These are not the only wonders of the world
When we come to it
We this people on this minuscule and kithless globe
Who reach daily for the bomb the blade and the dagger
Yet who petition in the dark for tokens of peace
We this people on this mote of matter
In whose mouths abide cankerous words
Which challenge our very existence
Yet out of those same mouths
Come songs of such exquisite sweetness
That the heart falters in its labor
And the body is quieted into awe
We this people on this small and drifting planet
Whose hands can strike with such abandon
That in a twinkling life is sapped from the living
Yet those same hands can touch with such healing irresistible tenderness
That the haughty neck is happy to bow
And the proud back is glad to bend
Out of such chaos of such contradiction
We learn that we are neither devils nor divines
When we come to it
We this people on this wayward floating body
Created on this earth of this earth
Have the power to fashion for this earth
A climate where every man and every woman
Can live freely without sanctimonious piety
Without crippling fear
When we come to it
We must confess that we are the possible
We are the miraculous the true wonder of this world
That is when and only when
We come to it
Give me your hand
Make room for me
to lead and follow
you
beyond this rage of poetry
Let others have
the privacy of
touching words
and love of loss
of love
For me
Give me your hand
There is no warning rattle at the door
nor heavy feet to stomp the foyer boards
Safe in the dark prison I know that
light slides over
the fingered work of a toothless
woman in Pakistan
Happy prints of
an invisible time are illumined
My mouth agape
rejects the solid air and
lungs hold The invader takes
direction and
seeps through the plaster walls
It is at my chamber entering
the keyhole pushing
through the padding of the door
I cannot scream A bone
of fear clogs my throat
It is upon me It is
sunrise with Hope
its arrogant rider
My mind formerly quiescent
in its snug encasement is strained
to look upon their rapturous visages
to let them enter even into me
I am forced
outside myself to
mount the light and ride joined with Hope
Through all the bright hours
I cling to expectation until
darkness comes to reclaim me
as its own Hope fades day is gone
into its irredeemable place
and I am thrown back into the familiar
bonds of disconsolation
Gloom crawls around
lapping lasciviously
between my toes at my ankles
and it sucks the strands of my
hair It forgives my heady
fling with Hope I am
joined again into its
greedy arms
Dancin the funky chicken
Eatin ribs and tips
Diggin all the latest sounds
And drinkin gin in sips
Puttin down that dorag
Tighten up my fro
Wrappin up in Blackness
Dont I shine and glow
Hearin Stevie Wonder
Cookin beans and rice
Goin to the opera
Checkin out Leontyne Price
Get down Jesse Jackson
Dance on Alvin Ailey
Talk Miss Barbara Jordan
Groove Miss Pearlie Bailey
Now aint they bad
An aint they Black
An aint they Black
An aint they Bad
An aint they bad
An aint they Black
An aint they fine
Black like the hour of the night
When your love turns and wriggles close to your side
Black as the earth which has given birth
To nations and when all else is gone will abide
Bad as the storm that leaps raging from the heavens
Bringing the welcome rain
Bad as the sun burning orange hot at midday
Lifting the waters again
Arthur Ashe on the tennis court
Mohammed Ali in the ring
Andre Watts and Andrew Young
Black men doing their thing
Dressing in purples and pinks and greens
Exotic as rum and Cokes
Living our lives with flash and style
Aint we colorful folks
Now aint we bad
An aint we Black
An aint we Black
An aint we bad
An aint we bad
An aint we Black
An aint we fine
Lying thinking
Last night
How to find my soul a home
Where water is not thirsty
And bread loaf is not stone
I came up with one thing
And I dont believe Im wrong
That nobody
But nobody
Can make it out here alone
Alone all alone
Nobody but nobody
Can make it out here alone
There are some millionaires
With money they cant use
Their wives run round like banshees
Their children sing the blues
Theyve got expensive doctors
To cure their hearts of stone
But nobody
No nobody
Can make it out here alone
Alone all alone
Nobody but nobody
Can make it out here alone
Now if you listen closely
Ill tell you what I know
Storm clouds are gathering
The wind is gonna blow
The race of man is suffering
And I can hear the moan
Cause nobody
But nobody
Can make it out here alone
Alone all alone
Nobody but nobody
Can make it out here alone
Curtains forcing their will
against the wind
children sleep
exchanging dreams with
seraphim The city
drags itself awake on
subway straps and
I an alarm awake as a
rumor of war
lie stretching into dawn
unasked and unheeded
The free bird leaps
on the back of the wind
and floats downstream
till the current ends
and dips his wings
in the orange sun rays
and dares to claim the sky
But a bird that stalks
down his narrow cage
can seldom see through
his bars of rage
his wings are clipped and
his feet are tied
so he opens his throat to sing
The caged bird sings
with fearful trill
of the things unknown
but longed for still
and his tune is heard
on the distant hill
for the caged bird
sings of freedom
The free bird thinks of another breeze
and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees
and the fat worms waiting on a dawnbright lawn
and he names the sky his own
But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams
his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream
his wings are clipped and his feet are tied
so he opens his throat to sing
The caged bird sings
with a fearful trill
of things unknown
but longed for still
and his tune is heard
on the distant hill
for the caged bird
sings of freedom
FOR DAVID PB
The eye follows the land
Slips upward creases down forms
The gentle buttocks of a young
Giant In the nestle
Old adobe bricks washed of
Whiteness paled to umber
Await another century
Star Jasmine and old vines
Lay claim upon the ghosted land
Then quiet pools whisper
Private childhood secrets
Flush on inner cottage walls
Antiquitous faces
Used to the gelid breath
Of old manors glare disdainfully
Over breached time
Around and through these
Cold phantasmatalities
He walks insisting
To the languid air
Activity music
A generosity of graces
His lupin fields spurn old
Deceit and agile poppies dance
In golden riot Each day is
Fulminant exploding brightly
Under the gaze of his exquisite
Sires frozen in the famed paint
Of dead masters Audacious
Sunlight casts defiance
At their feet
You declare you see me dimly
through a glass which will not shine
though I stand before you boldly
trim in rank and marking time
You do own to hear me faintly
as a whisper out of range
while my drums beat out the message
and the rhythms never change
Equality and I will be free
Equality and I will be free
You announce my ways are wanton
that I fly from man to man
but if Im just a shadow to you
could you ever understand
We have lived a painful history
we know the shameful past
but I keep on marching forward
and you keep on coming last
Equality and I will be free
Equality and I will be free
Take the blinders from your vision
take the padding from your ears
and confess youve heard me crying
and admit youve seen my tears
Hear the tempo so compelling
hear the blood throb in my veins
Yes my drums are beating nightly
and the rhythms never change
Equality and I will be free
Equality and I will be free
Glory falls around us
as we sob
a dirge of
desolation on the Cross
and hatred is the ballast of
the rock
which his upon our necks
and underfoot
We have woven
robes of silk
and clothed our nakedness
with tapestry
From crawling on this
murky planets floor
we soar beyond the
birds and
through the clouds
and edge our waays from hate
and blind despair and
bring horror
to our brothers and to our sisters cheer
We grow despite the
horror that we feed
upon our own
tomorrow
We grow
One foot down then hop Its hot
Good things for the ones thats got
Another jump now to the left
Everybody for hisself
In the air now both feet down
Since you black dont stick around
Food is gone the rent is due
Curse and cry and then jump two
All the people out of work
Hold for three then twist and jerk
Cross the line they count you out
Thats what hoppings all about
Both feet flat the game is done
They think I lost I think I won
I note the obvious differences
in the human family
Some of us are serious
some thrive on comedy
Some declare their lives are lived
as true profundity
and others claim they really live
the real reality
The variety of our skin tones
can confuse bemuse delight
brown and pink and beige and purple
tan and blue and white
Ive sailed upon the seven seas
and stopped in every land
Ive seen the wonders of the world
not yet one common man
I know ten thousand women
called Jane and Mary Jane
but Ive not seen any two
who really were the same
Mirror twins are different
although their features jibe
and lovers think quite different thoughts
while lying side by side
We love and lose in China
we weep on Englands moors
and laugh and moan in Guinea
and thrive on Spanish shores
We seek success in Finland
are born and die in Maine
In minor ways we differ
in major were the same
I note the obvious differences
between each sort and type
but we are more alike my friends
than we are unalike
We are more alike my friends
than we are unalike
We are more alike my friends
than we are unalike
A free bird leaps on the back
Of the wind and floats downstream
Till the current ends and dips his wing
In the orange suns rays
And dares to claim the sky
But a BIRD that stalks down his narrow cage
Can seldom see through his bars of rage
His wings are clipped and his feet are tied
So he opens his throat to sing
The caged bird sings with a fearful trill
Of things unknown but longed for still
And his tune is heard on the distant hill for
The caged bird sings of freedom
The free bird thinks of another breeze
And the trade winds soft through
The sighing trees
And the fat worms waiting on a dawnbright
Lawn and he names the sky his own
But a caged BIRD stands on the grave of dreams
His shadow shouts on a nightmare scream

A fearful trill of things unknown
But longed for still and his
Tune is heard on the distant hill
For the caged bird sings of freedom
In my young years I took pride in the fact that luck was called a lady In fact there were so few public acknowledgments of the female presence that I felt personally honored whenever nature and large ships were referred to as feminine But as I matured I began to resent being considered a sister to a changeling as fickle as luck as aloof as an ocean and as frivolous as nature The phrase A woman always has the right to change her mind played so aptly into the negative image of the female that I made myself a victim to an unwavering decision Even if I made an inane and stupid choice I stuck by it rather than be like a woman and change my mind
Being a woman is hard work Not without joy and even ecstasy but still relentless unending work Becoming an old female may require only being born with certain genitalia inheriting longliving genes and the fortune not to be run over by an outofcontrol truck but to become and remain a woman command the existence and employment of genius
The woman who survives intact and happy must be at once tender and tough She must have convinced herself or be in the unending process of convincing herself that she her values and her choices are important In a time a nd world where males hold sway and control the pressure upon women to yield their rightsofway is tremendous And it is under those very circumstances that the womans toughness must be in evidence
She must resist considering herself a lesser version of her male counterpart She is not a sculptress poetess authoress Jewess Negress or even now rare in university parlance a rectoress If she is the thing then for her own sense of self and for the education of the illinformed she must insist with rectitude in being the thing and in being called the thing
A rose by any other name may smell as sweet but a woman called by a devaluing name will only be weakened by the misnomer She will need to prize her tenderness and be able to display it at appropriate times in order to prevent toughness from gaining total authority and to avoid becoming a mirror image of those men who value power above life and control over love
It is imperative that a woman keep her sense of humor intact and at the ready She must see even if only in secret that she is the funniest looniest woman in her world which she should also see as being the most absurd world of all times It has been said that laughter is therapeutic and amiability lengthens the life span Women should be tough tender laugh as much as possible and live long lives The struggle for equality continues unabated and the woman warrior who is armed with wit and courage will be among the first to celebrate victory
There are some nights when
sleep plays coy
aloof and disdainful
And all the wiles
that I employ to win
its service to my side
are useless as wounded pride
and much more painful
FOR BAILEY
We were entwined in red rings
Of blood and loneliness before
The first snows fell
Before muddy rivers seeded clouds
Above a virgin forest and
Men ran naked blue and black
Skinned into the warm embraces
Of Sheba Eve and Lilith
I was your sister
You left me to force strangers
Into brother molds exacting
Taxations they never
Owed or could ever pay
You fought to die thinking
In destruction lies the seed
Of birth You may be right
I will remember silent walks in
Southern woods and long talks
In low voices
Shielding meaning from the big ears
Of overcurious adults
You may be right
Your slow return from
Regions of terror and bloody
Screams races my heart
I hear again the laughter
Of children and see fireflies
Bursting tiny explosions in
An Arkansas twilight
Shadows on the wall
Noises down the hall
Life doesnt frighten me at all

Bad dogs barking loud
Big ghosts in a cloud
Life doesnt frighten me at all

Mean old Mother Goose
Lions on the loose
They dont frighten me at all

Dragons breathing flame
On my counterpane
That doesnt frighten me at all

I go boo
Make them shoo
I make fun
Way they run
I wont cry
So they fly
I just smile
They go wild

Life doesnt frighten me at all

Tough guys fight
All alone at night
Life doesnt frighten me at all

Panthers in the park
Strangers in the dark
No they dont frighten me at all

That new classroom where
Boys all pull my hair
Kissy little girls
With their hair in curls
They dont frighten me at all

Dont show me frogs and snakes
And listen for my scream
If Im afraid at all
Its only in my dreams

Ive got a magic charm
That I keep up my sleeve
I can walk the ocean floor
And never have to breathe

Life doesnt frighten me at all
Not at all
Not at all

Life doesnt frighten me at all
When I was young I used to
Watch behind the curtains
As men walked up and down the street Wino men old men
Young men sharp as mustard
See them Men are always
Going somewhere
They knew I was there Fifteen
Years old and starving for them
Under my window they would pauses
Their shoulders high like the
Breasts of a young girl
Jacket tails slapping over
Those behinds
Men
One day they hold you in the
Palms of their hands gentle as if you
Were the last raw egg in the world Then
They tighten up Just a little The
First squeeze is nice A quick hug
Soft into your defenselessness A little
More The hurt begins Wrench out a
Smile that slides around the fear When the
Air disappears
Your mind pops exploding fiercely briefly
Like the head of a kitchen match Shattered
It is your juice
That runs down their legs Staining their shoes
When the earth rights itself again
And taste tries to return to the tongue
Your body has slammed shut Forever
No keys exist
Then the window draws full upon
Your mind There just beyond
The sway of curtains men walk
Knowing something
Going someplace
But this time I will simply
Stand and watch
Maybe
The night has been long
The wound has been deep
The pit has been dark
And the walls have been steep
Under a dead blue sky on a distant beach
I was dragged by my braids just beyond your reach
Your hands were tied your mouth was bound
You couldnt even call out my name
You were helpless and so was I
But unfortunately throughout history
Youve worn a badge of shame
I say the night has been long
The wound has been deep
The pit has been dark
And the walls have been steep
But today voices of old spirit sound
Speak to us in words profound
Across the years across the centuries
Across the oceans and across the seas
They say draw near to one another
Save your race
You have been paid for in a distant place
The old ones remind us that slaverys chains
Have paid for our freedom again and again
The night has been long
The pit has been deep
The night has been dark
And the walls have been steep
The hells we have lived through and live through still
Have sharpened our senses and toughened our will
The night has been long
This morning I look through your anguish
Right down to your soul
I know that with each other we can make ourselves whole
I look through the posture and past your disguise
And see your love for family in your big brown eyes
I say clap hands and lets come together in this meeting ground
I say clap hands and lets deal with each other with love
I say clap hands and let us get from the low road of indifference
Clap hands let us come together and reveal our hearts
Let us come together and revise our spirits
Let us come together and cleanse our souls
Clap hands lets leave the preening
And stop impostering our own history
Clap hands call the spirits back from the ledge
Clap hands let us invite joy into our conversation
Courtesy into our bedrooms
Gentleness into our kitchen
Care into our nursery
The ancestors remind us despite the history of pain
We are a goingon people who will rise again
And still we rise
Her arms semaphore fat triangles
Pudgy hands bunched on layered hips
Where bones idle under years of fatback
And lima beans
Her jowls shiver in accusation
Of crimes clichéd by
Repetition Her children strangers
To childhoods toys play
Best the games of darkened doorways
Rooftop tag and know the slick feel of
Other peoples property
Too fat to whore
Too mad to work
Searches her dreams for the
Lucky sign and walks barehanded
Into a den of bureaucrats for
Her portion
They dont give me welfare
I take it
They have spent their
content of simpering
holding their lips this
and that way winding
the lines between
their brows Old folks
allow their bellies to jiggle like slow
tambourines
The hollers
rise up and spill
over any way they want
When old folks laugh they free the world
They turn slowly slyly knowing
the best and the worst
of remembering
Saliva glistens in
the corners of their mouths
their heads wobble
on brittle necks but
their laps
are filled with memories
When old folks laugh they consider the promise
of dear painless death and generously
forgive life for happening
to them
When you see me sitting quietly
Like a sack left on the shelf
Don’t think I need your chattering
I’m listening to myself
Hold Stop Don’t pity me
Hold Stop your sympathy
Understanding if you got it
Otherwise I’ll do without it
When my bones are stiff and aching
And my feet won’t climb the stair
I will only ask one favor
Don’t bring me no rocking chair
When you see me walking stumbling
Don’t study and get it wrong
‘Cause tired don’t mean lazy
And every goodbye ain’t gone
I’m the same person I was back then
A little less hair a little less chin
A lot less lungs and much less wind
But ain’t I lucky I can still breathe in
A Rock A River A Tree
Hosts to species long since departed
Mark the mastodon
The dinosaur who left dry tokens
Of their sojourn here
On our planet floor
Any broad alarm of their of their hastening doom
Is lost in the gloom of dust and ages
But today the Rock cries out to us clearly forcefully
Come you may stand upon my
Back and face your distant destiny
But seek no haven in my shadow
I will give you no hiding place down here
You created only a little lower than
The angels have crouched too long in
The bruising darkness
Have lain too long
Face down in ignorance
Your mouths spelling words
Armed for slaughter
The rock cries out today you may stand on me
But do not hide your face
Across the wall of the world
A river sings a beautiful song
Come rest here by my side
Each of you a bordered country
Delicate and strangely made proud
Yet thrusting perpetually under siege
Your armed struggles for profit
Have left collars of waste upon
My shore currents of debris upon my breast
Yet today I call you to my riverside
If you will study war no more
Come clad in peace and I will sing the songs
The Creator gave to me when I
And the tree and stone were one
Before cynicism was a bloody sear across your brow
And when you yet knew you still knew nothing
The river sings and sings on
There is a true yearning to respond to
The singing river and the wise rock
So say the Asian the Hispanic the Jew
The African and Native American the Sioux
The Catholic the Muslim the French the Greek
The Irish the Rabbi the Priest the Sheikh
The Gay the Straight the Preacher
The privileged the homeless the teacher
They hear They all hear
The speaking of the tree
Today the first and last of every tree
Speaks to humankind Come to me here beside the river
Plant yourself beside me here beside the river
Each of you descendant of some passed on
Traveller has been paid for
You who gave me my first name
You Pawnee Apache and Seneca
You Cherokee Nation who rested with me
Then forced on bloody feet
Left me to the employment of other seekers
Desperate for gain starving for gold
You the Turk the Swede the German the Scot
You the Ashanti the Yoruba the Kru
Bought sold stolen arriving on a nightmare
Praying for a dream
Here root yourselves beside me
I am the tree planted by the river
Which will not be moved
I the rock I the river I the tree
I am yours your passages have been paid
Lift up your faces you have a piercing need
For this bright morning dawning for you
History despite its wrenching pain
Cannot be unlived and if faced with courage
Need not be lived again
Lift up your eyes upon
The day breaking for you
Give birth again
To the dream
Women children men
Take it into the palms of your hands
Mold it into the shape of your most
Private need Sculpt it into
The image of your most public self
Lift up your hearts
Each new hour holds new chances
For new beginnings
Do not be wedded forever
To fear yoked eternally
To brutishness
The horizon leans forward
Offering you space to place new steps of change
Here on the pulse of this fine day
You may have the courage
To look up and out upon me
The rock the river the tree your country
No less to Midas than the mendicant
No less to you now than the mastodon then
Here on the pulse of this new day
You may have the grace to look up and out
And into your sisters eyes
Into your brothers face your country
And say simply
Very simply
With hope
Good morning
She lay skin down in the moist dirt
the canebrake rustling
with the whispers of leaves and
loud longing of hounds and
the ransack of hunters crackling the near
branches
She muttered lifting her head a nod toward
freedom
I shall not I shall not be moved
She gathered her babies
their tears slick as oil on black faces
their young eyes canvassing mornings of madness
Momma is Master going to sell you
from us tomorrow
Yes
Unless you keep walking more
and talking less
Yes
Unless the keeper of our lives
releases me from all commandments
Yes
And your lives
never mine to live
will be executed upon the killing floor of
innocents
Unless you match my heart and words
saying with me
I shall not be moved
In Virginia tobacco fields
leaning into the curve
of Steinway
pianos along Arkansas roads
in the red hills of Georgia
into the palms of her chained hands she
cried against calamity
You have tried to destroy me
and though I perish daily
I shall not be moved
Her universe often
summarized into one black body
falling finally from the tree to her feet
made her cry each time into a new voice
All my past hastens to defeat
and strangers claim the glory of my love
Iniquity has bound me to his bed
yet I must not be moved
She heard the names
swirling ribbons in the wind of history
nigger nigger bitch heifer
mammy property creature ape baboon
whore hot tail thing it
She said But my description cannot
fit your tongue for
I have a certain way of being in this world
and I shall not I shall not be moved
No angel stretched protecting wings
above the heads of her children
fluttering and urging the winds of reason
into the confusions of their lives
The sprouted like young weeds
but she could not shield their growth
from the grinding blades of ignorance nor
shape them into symbolic topiaries
She sent them away
underground overland in coaches and
shoeless
When you learn teach
When you get give
As for me
I shall not be moved
She stood in midocean seeking dry land
She searched Gods face
Assured
she placed her fire of service
on the altar and though
clothed in the finery of faith
when she appeared at the temple door
no sign welcomed
Black Grandmother Enter here
Into the crashing sound
into wickedness she cried
No one no nor no one million
ones dare deny me God I go forth
along and stand as ten thousand
The Divine upon my right
impels me to pull forever
at the latch on Freedoms gate
The Holy Spirit upon my left leads my
feet without ceasing into the camp of the
righteous and into the tents of the free
These momma faces lemonyellow plumpurple
honeybrown have grimaced and twisted
down a pyramid for years
She is Sheba the Sojourner
Harriet and Zora
Mary Bethune and Angela
Annie to Zenobia
She stands
before the abortion clinic
confounded by the lack of choices
In the Welfare line
reduced to the pity of handouts
Ordained in the pulpit shielded
by the mysteries
In the operating room
husbanding life
In the choir loft
holding God in her throat
On lonely street corners
hawking her body
In the classroom loving the
children to understanding
Centered on the worlds stage
she sings to her loves and beloveds
to her foes and detractors
However I am perceived and deceived
however my ignorance and conceits
lay aside your fears that I will be undone
for I shall not be moved
Your skin like dawn
Mine like musk
One paints the beginning
of a certain end
The other the end of a
sure beginning
Theres a longlegged girl
in San Francisco
by the Golden Gate
She said shed give me all I wanted
but I just couldnt wait
I started to
Pickin em up
and layin em down
Pickin em up
and layin em down
Pickin em up
and layin em down
gettin to the next town
Baby
Theres a pretty brown
in Birmingham
Boys she little and cute
but when she like to tied me down
I had to grab my suit and started to
Pickin em up
and layin em down
Pickin em up
and layin em down
Pickin em up
and layin em down
getting to the next town
Baby
I met that lovely Detroit lady
and thought my time had come
But just before I said I do
I said I got to run and started to
Pickin em up
and layin em down
Pickin em up
and layin em down
Pickin em up
and layin em down
getting to the next town
Baby
There aint no words for what I feel
about a pretty face
But if I stay I just might miss
a prettier one some place
I started to
Pickin em up
and layin em down
Pickin em up
and layin em down
Pickin em up
and layin em down
getting to the next town
Baby
Preacher dont send me
when I die
to some big ghetto
in the sky
where rats eat cats
of the leopard type
and Sunday brunch
is grits and tripe
Ive known those rats
Ive seen them kill
and grits Ive had
would make a hill
or maybe a mountain
so what I need
from you on Sunday
is a different creed
Preacher please dont
promise me
streets of gold
and milk for free
I stopped all milk
at four years old
and once Im dead
I wont need gold
Id call a place
pure paradise
where families are loyal
and strangers are nice
where the music is jazz
and the season is fall
Promise me that
or nothing at all
A Last love
proper in conclusion
should snip the wings
forbidding further flight
But I now
reft of that confusion
am lifted up
and speeding toward the light
Beloved
In what other lives or lands
Have I known your lips
Your Hands
Your Laughter brave
Irreverent
Those sweet excesses that
I do adore
What surety is there
That we will meet again
On other worlds some
Future time undated
I defy my bodys haste
Without the promise
Of one more sweet encounter
I will not deign to die
Your hands easy
weight teasing the bees
hived in my hair your smile at the
slope of my cheek On the
occasion you press
above me glowing spouting
readiness mystery rapes
my reason
When you have withdrawn
your self and the magic when
only the smell of your
love lingers between
my breasts then only
then can I greedily consume
your presence
Petulant priests greedy
centurions and one million
incensed gestures stand
between your love and me
Your agape sacrifice
is reduced to colored glass
vapid penance and the
tedium of ritual
Your footprints yet
mark the crest of
billowing seas but
your joy
fades upon the tablets
of ordained prophets
Visit us again Savior
Your children burdened with
disbelief blinded by a patina
of wisdom
carom down this vale of
fear We cry for you
although we have lost
your name
I start no
wars raining poison
on cathedrals
melting Stars of David
into golden faucets
to be lighted by lamps
shaded by human skin
I set no
store on the strange lands
send no
missionaries beyond my
borders
to plunder secrets
and barter souls
They
say you took my manhood
Momma
Come sit on my lap
and tell me
what do you want me to say
to them just
before I annihilate
their ignorance
My Fathers sit on benches
their flesh counts every plank
the slats leave dents of darkness
deep in their withered flanks
They nod like broken candles
all waxed and burnt profound
they say Its understanding
that makes the world go round
There in those pleated faces
I see the auction block
the chains and slaverys coffles
the whip and lash and stock
My Fathers speak in voices
that shred my fact and sound
they say Its our submission
that makes the world go round
They used the finest cunning
their naked wits and wiles
the lowly Uncle Tomming
and Aunt Jemimas smiles
Theyve laughed to shield their crying
then shuffled through their dreams
and stepped n fetched a country
to write the blues with screams
I understand their meaning
it could and did derive
from living on the edge of death
They kept my race alive
You may write me down in history
With your bitter twisted lies
You may tread me in the very dirt
But still like dust Ill rise
Does my sassiness upset you
Why are you beset with gloom
Cause I walk like Ive got oil wells
Pumping in my living room
Just like moons and like suns
With the certainty of tides
Just like hopes springing high
Still Ill rise
Did you want to see me broken
Bowed head and lowered eyes
Shoulders falling down like teardrops
Weakened by my soulful cries
Does my haughtiness offend you
Dont you take it awful hard
Cause I laugh like Ive got gold mines
Diggin in my own back yard
You may shoot me with your words
You may cut me with your eyes
You may kill me with your hatefulness
But still like air Ill rise
Does my sexiness upset you
Does it come as a surprise
That I dance like Ive got diamonds
At the meeting of my thighs
Out of the huts of historys shame
I rise
Up from a past thats rooted in pain
I rise
Im a black ocean leaping and wide
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide
Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
I rise
Into a daybreak thats wondrously clear
I rise
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave
I am the dream and the hope of the slave
I rise
I rise
I rise
Televised news turns
a halfused day into
a waste of desolation
If nothing wondrous preceded
the catastrophic announcements
certainly nothing will follow save
the sadeyed faces of
bony children
distended bellies making
mock at their starvation
Why are they always
Black
Whom do they await
The lambchop flesh
reeks and cannot be
eaten Even the
green peas roll on my plate
unmolested Their innocence
matched by the helpless
hope in the childrens faces
Why do Black children
hope Who will bring
them peas and lamb chops
and one more morning
BECAUSE we have forgotten our ancestors
our children no longer give us honor
BECAUSE we have lost the path our ancestors cleared
kneeling in perilous undergrowth
our children cannot find their way
BECAUSE we have banished the God of our ancestors
our children cannot pray
BECAUSE the old wails of our ancestors have faded beyond our hearing
our children cannot hear us crying
BECAUSE we have abandoned our wisdom of mothering and fathering
our befuddled children give birth to children
they neither want nor understand
BECAUSE we have forgotten how to love the adversary is within our
gates an holds us up to the mirror of the world shouting
Regard the loveless
Therefore we pledge to bind ourselves to one another to embrace our
lowliest to keep company with our loneliest to educate our illiterate
to feed our starving to clothe our ragged to do all good things
knowing that we are more than keepers of our brothers and sisters
We ARE our brothers and sisters
IN HONOR of those who toiled and implored God with golden tongues
and in gratitude to the same God who brought us out of hopeless desolation we make this pledge
The HealthFood Diner
No sprouted wheat and soya shoots
And Brussels in a cake
Carrot straw and spinach raw
Today I need a steak
Not thick brown rice and rice pilaw
Or mushrooms creamed on toast
Turnips mashed and parsnips hashed
Im dreaming of a roast
Healthfood folks around the world
Are thinned by anxious zeal
They look for help in seafood kelp
I count on breaded veal
No smoking signs raw mustard greens
Zucchini by the ton
Uncooked kale and bodies frail
Are sure to make me run
to
Loins of pork and chicken thighs
And standing rib so prime
Pork chops brown and fresh ground round
I crave them all the time
Irish stews and boiled corned beef
and hot dogs by the scores
or any place that saves a space
For smoking carnivores
I keep on dying again
Veins collapse opening like the
Small fists of sleeping
Children
Memory of old tombs
Rotting flesh and worms do
Not convince me against
The challenge The years
And cold defeat live deep in
Lines along my face
They dull my eyes yet
I keep on dying
Because I love to live
She came home running
back to the mothering blackness
deep in the smothering blackness
white tears icicle gold plains of her face
She came home running
She came down creeping
here to the black arms waiting
now to the warm heart waiting
rime of alien dreams befrosts her rich brown face
She came down creeping
She came home blameless
black yet as Hagar’s daughter
tall as was Sheba’s daughter
threats of northern winds die on the desert’s face
She came home blameless
A Rock A River A Tree
Hosts to species long since departed
Mark the mastodon
The dinosaur who left dry tokens
Of their sojourn here
On our planet floor
Any broad alarm of their of their hastening doom
Is lost in the gloom of dust and ages
But today the Rock cries out to us clearly forcefully
Come you may stand upon my
Back and face your distant destiny
But seek no haven in my shadow
I will give you no hiding place down here
You created only a little lower than
The angels have crouched too long in
The bruising darkness
Have lain too long
Face down in ignorance
Your mouths spelling words
Armed for slaughter
The rock cries out today you may stand on me
But do not hide your face
Across the wall of the world
A river sings a beautiful song
Come rest here by my side
Each of you a bordered country
Delicate and strangely made proud
Yet thrusting perpetually under siege
Your armed struggles for profit
Have left collars of waste upon
My shore currents of debris upon my breast
Yet today I call you to my riverside
If you will study war no more
Come clad in peace and I will sing the songs
The Creator gave to me when I
And the tree and stone were one
Before cynicism was a bloody sear across your brow
And when you yet knew you still knew nothing
The river sings and sings on
There is a true yearning to respond to
The singing river and the wise rock
So say the Asian the Hispanic the Jew
The African and Native American the Sioux
The Catholic the Muslim the French the Greek
The Irish the Rabbi the Priest the Sheikh
The Gay the Straight the Preacher
The privileged the homeless the teacher
They hear They all hear
The speaking of the tree
Today the first and last of every tree
Speaks to humankind Come to me here beside the river
Plant yourself beside me here beside the river
Each of you descendant of some passed on
Traveller has been paid for
You who gave me my first name
You Pawnee Apache and Seneca
You Cherokee Nation who rested with me
Then forced on bloody feet
Left me to the employment of other seekers
Desperate for gain starving for gold
You the Turk the Swede the German the Scot
You the Ashanti the Yoruba the Kru
Bought sold stolen arriving on a nightmare
Praying for a dream
Here root yourselves beside me
I am the tree planted by the river
Which will not be moved
I the rock I the river I the tree
I am yours your passages have been paid
Lift up your faces you have a piercing need
For this bright morning dawning for you
History despite its wrenching pain
Cannot be unlived and if faced with courage
Need not be lived again
Lift up your eyes upon
The day breaking for you
Give birth again
To the dream
Women children men
Take it into the palms of your hands
Mold it into the shape of your most
Private need Sculpt it into
The image of your most public self
Lift up your hearts
Each new hour holds new chances
For new beginnings
Do not be wedded forever
To fear yoked eternally
To brutishness
The horizon leans forward
Offering you space to place new steps of change
Here on the pulse of this fine day
You may have the courage
To look up and out upon me
The rock the river the tree your country
No less to Midas than the mendicant
No less to you now than the mastodon then
Here on the pulse of this new day
You may have the grace to look up and out
And into your sisters eyes
Into your brothers face your country
And say simply
Very simply
With hope
Good morning
Byways and bygone
And lone nights long
Sun rays and sea waves
And star and stone
Manless and friendless
No cave my home
This is my torture
My long nights lone
The dark lantern of world sadness has cast its shadow upon the land
We stumble into our misery on leaden feet
Our minds seek to comprehend the unknowable and our hearts seek to
Measure a tomorrow without the Sunshine Princess
Her hands which had held bright tiaras and jewelled crowns
Also stroked the faces of pain along
Angolas dusty roads
She was born to the privilege of plenty
Yet she communed with the needy without a show of pompous piety
Glowing in Bosnia radiant at glittering balls
We came to love her and claim her for her grace and accessibility
Luminous always
We smiled to see her enter and grinned at her happiness
Now the world we made is forever changed…
Made smaller meaner less colorful
Yet because she did live
Because she ventured life and confronted change
She has left us a legacy
We also may dare…
To care for some other than ourselves and those who look like us
And maybe we can take a lesson from her
And try to live our lives
With passion compassion humor and grace
Goodbye Sunshine Princess
Tremors of your network
cause kings to disappear
Your open mouth in anger
makes nations bow in fear
Your bombs can change the seasons
obliterate the spring
What more do you long for
Why are you suffering
You control the human lives
in Rome and Timbuktu
Lonely nomads wandering
owe Telstar to you
Seas shift at your bidding
your mushrooms fill the sky
Why are you unhappy
Why do your children cry
They kneel alone in terror
with dread in every glance
Their nights rights Schrift nicht lesbar are threatened daily
by a grim inheritance
You dwell in whitened castles
with deep and poisoned moats
and cannot hear the curses
which fill your childrens throats
They went home and told their wives
that never once in all their lives
had they known a girl like me
But They went home
They said my house was licking clean
no word I spoke was ever mean
I had an air of mystery
But They went home
My praises were on all mens lips
they liked my smile my wit my hips
theyd spend one night or two or three
But
We unaccustomed to courage
exiles from delight
live coiled in shells of loneliness
until love leaves its high holy temple
and comes into our sight
to liberate us into life
Love arrives
and in its train come ecstasies
old memories of pleasure
ancient histories of pain
Yet if we are bold
love strikes away the chains of fear
from our souls
We are weaned from our timidity
In the flush of loves light
we dare be brave
And suddenly we see
that love costs all we are
and will ever be
Yet it is only love
which sets us free
Beloveds now we know that we know nothing
Now that our bright and shining star can slip away from our fingertips like a puff of summer wind
Without notice our dear love can escape our doting embrace
Sing our songs among the stars and and walk our dances across the face of the moon
In the instant we learn that Michael is gone we know nothing
No clocks can tell our time and no oceans can rush our tides
With the abrupt absence of our treasure
Though we our many each of us is achingly alone
Piercingly alone
Only when we confess our confusion can we remember that he was a gift to us and we did have him
He came to us from the Creator trailing creativity in abundance
Despite the anguish of life he was sheathed in mother love and family love and survived and did more than that
He thrived with passion and compassion humor and style
We had him
Whether we knew who he was or did not know he was ours and we were his
We had him
Beautiful delighting our eyes
He raked his hat slant over his brow and took a pose on his toes for all of us and we laughed and stomped our feet for him
We were enchanted with his passion because he held nothing
He gave us all he had been given
Today in Tokyo beneath the Eiffel Tower in Ghanas Blackstar Square in Johannesburg in Pittsburgh in Birmingham Alabama and Birmingham England we are missing Michael Jackson
But we do know that we had him
And we are the world
Some clichty folks
dont know the facts
posin and preenin
and puttin on acts
stretchin their backs
They move into condos
up over the ranks
pawn their souls
to the local banks
Buying big cars
they cant afford
ridin around town
actin bored
If they want to learn how to live life right
they ought to study me on Saturday night
My job at the plant
aint the biggest bet
but I pay my bills
and stay out of debt
I get my hair done
for my own selfs sake
so I dont have to pick
and I dont have to rake
Take the church money out
and head cross town
to my friend girls house
where we plan our round
We meet our men and go to a joint
where the music is blue
and to the point
Folks write about me
They just cant see
how I work all week
at the factory
Then get spruced up
and laugh and dance
And turn away from worry
with sassy glance
They accuse me of livin
from day to day
but who are they kiddin
So are they
My life aint heaven
but it sure aint hell
Im not on top
but I call it swell
if Im able to work
and get paid right
and have the luck to be Black
on a Saturday night
When great trees fall
rocks on distant hills shudder
lions hunker down
in tall grasses
and even elephants
lumber after safety
When great trees fall
in forests
small things recoil into silence
their senses
eroded beyond fear
When great souls die
the air around us becomes
light rare sterile
We breathe briefly
Our eyes briefly
see with
a hurtful clarity
Our memory suddenly sharpened
examines
gnaws on kind words
unsaid
promised walks
never taken
Great souls die and
our reality bound to
them takes leave of us
Our souls
dependent upon their
nurture
now shrink wizened
Our minds formed
and informed by their
radiance
fall away
We are not so much maddened
as reduced to the unutterable ignorance
of dark cold
caves
And when great souls die
after a period peace blooms
slowly and always
irregularly Spaces fill
with a kind of
soothing electric vibration
Our senses restored never
to be the same whisper to us
They existed They existed
We can be Be and be
better For they existed
When I think about myself
I almost laugh myself to death
My life has been one great big joke
A dance thats walked
A song thats spoke
I laugh so hard I almost choke
When I think about myself
Sixty years in these folks world
The child I works for calls me girl
I say Yes maam for workings sake
Too proud to bend
Too poor to break
I laugh until my stomach ache
When I think about myself
My folks can make me split my side
I laughed so hard I nearly died
The tales they tell sound just like lying
They grow the fruit
But eat the rind
I laugh until I start to crying
When I think about my folks
When you come to me unbidden
Beckoning me
To longago rooms
Where memories lie
Offering me as to a child an attic
Gatherings of days too few
Baubles of stolen kisses
Trinkets of borrowed loves
Trunks of secret words
I CRY
Ive got the children to tend
The clothes to mend
The floor to mop
The food to shop
Then the chicken to fry
The baby to dry
I got company to feed
The garden to weed
Ive got shirts to press
The tots to dress
The can to be cut
I gotta clean up this hut
Then see about the sick
And the cotton to pick
Shine on me sunshine
Rain on me rain
Fall softly dewdrops
And cool my brow again
Storm blow me from here
With your fiercest wind
Let me float across the sky
Til I can rest again
Fall gently snowflakes
Cover me with white
Cold icy kisses and
Let me rest tonight
Sun rain curving sky
Mountain oceans leaf and stone
Star shine moon glow
Youre all that I can call my own
