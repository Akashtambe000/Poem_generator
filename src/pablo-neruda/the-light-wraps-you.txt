The light wraps you in its mortal flame
Abstracted pale mourner standing that way
against the old propellers of the twighlight
that revolves around you
Speechless my friend
alone in the loneliness of this hour of the dead
and filled with the lives of fire
pure heir of the ruined day
A bough of fruit falls from the sun on your dark garment
The great roots of night
grow suddenly from your soul
and the things that hide in you come out again
so that a blue and palled people
your newly born takes nourishment
Oh magnificent and fecund and magnetic slave
of the circle that moves in turn through black and gold
rise lead and possess a creation
so rich in life that its flowers perish
and it is full of sadness
