The artichoke
With a tender heart
Dressed up like a warrior
Standing at attention it built
A small helmet
Under its scales
It remained
Unshakeable
By its side
The crazy vegetables
Uncurled
Their tendrills and leaf-crowns
Throbbing bulbs
In the sub-soil
The carrot
With its red mustaches
Was sleeping
The grapevine
Hung out to dry its branches
Through which the wine will rise
The cabbage
Dedicated itself
To trying on skirts
The oregano
To perfuming the world
And the sweet
Artichoke
There in the garden
Dressed like a warrior
Burnished
Like a proud
Pomegrante
And one day
Side by side
In big wicker baskets
Walking through the market
To realize their dream
The artichoke army
In formation
Never was it so military
Like on parade
The men
In their white shirts
Among the vegetables
Were
The Marshals
Of the artichokes
Lines in close order
Command voices
And the bang
Of a falling box
But
Then
Maria
Comes
With her basket
She chooses
An artichoke
She's not afraid of it
She examines it she observes it
Up against the light like it was an egg
She buys it
She mixes it up
In her handbag
With a pair of shoes
With a cabbage head and a
Bottle
Of vinegar
Until
She enters the kitchen
And submerges it in a pot
Thus ends
In peace
This career
Of the armed vegetable
Which is called an artichoke
Then
Scale by scale
We strip off
The delicacy
And eat
The peaceful mush
Of its green heart
