Oh yes I knew him I spent years with him
with his golden and stony substance
he was a man who was tired 
in Paraguay he left his father and mother
his sons his nephews
his latest in-laws
his house his chickens
and some half-opened books
They called him to the door
When he opened it the police took him
and they beat him up so much
that he spat blood in France in Denmark
in Spain in Italy moving about
and so he died and I stopped seeing his face
stopped hearing his profound silence 
then once on a night of storms
with snow spreading
a smooth cloak on the mountains
on horseback there far off
I looked and there was my friend 
his face was formed in stone
his profile defied the wild weather
in his nose the wind was muffling
the moaning of the persecuted
There the exile came to ground
Changed into stone he lives in his own country
