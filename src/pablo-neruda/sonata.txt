Neither the heart cut by a piece of glass
in a wasteland of thorns
nor the atrocious waters seen in the corners
of certain houses waters like eyelids and eyes
can capture your waist in my hands
when my heart lifts its oaks
towards your unbreakable thread of snow
Nocturnal sugar spirit
of the crowns
ransomed
human blood your kisses
send into exile
and a stroke of water with remnants of the sea
neats on the silences that wait for you
surrounding the worn chairs wearing out doors
Nights with bright spindles
divided material nothing
but voice nothing but
naked every day
Over your breasts of motionless current
over your legs of firmness and water
over the permanence and the pride
of your naked hair
I want to be my love now that the tears are
thrown
into the raucous baskets where they accumulate
I want to be my love alone with a syllable
of mangled silver alone with a tip
of your breast of snow
