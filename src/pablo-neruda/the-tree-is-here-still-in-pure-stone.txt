The tree is here still in pure stone
in deep evidence in solid beauty
layered through a hundred million years
Agate cornelian gemstone
transmuted the timber and sap
until damp corruptions
fissured the giant's trunk
fusing a parallel being
the living leaves
unmade themselves
and when the pillar was overthrown
fire in the forest blaze of the dust-cloud
celestial ashes mantled it round
until time and the lava created
this gift of translucent stone
