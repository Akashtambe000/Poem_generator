My eyes went away from me
Following a dark girl who went by
She was made of black motherofpearl
Made of darkpurple grapes
And she lashed my blood
With her tail of fire
After them all I go
A pale blonde went by
Like a golden plant
Swaying her gifts
And my mouth went
Like a wave
Discharging on her breast
Lightningbolts of blood
After them all I go
But to you without my moving
Without seeing you distant you
Go my blood and my kisses
My dark one and my fair one
My broad one and my slender one
My ugly one my beauty
Made of all the gold
And of all the silver
Made of all the wheat
And of all the earth
Made of all the water
Of sea waves
Made for my arms
Made for my kisses
Made for my soul
