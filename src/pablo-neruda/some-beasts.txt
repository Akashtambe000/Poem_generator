It was the twilight of the iguana
From a rainbowing battlement
a tongue like a javelin
lunging in verdure
an ant heap treading the jungle
monastic on musical feet
the guanaco oxygen-fine
in the high places swarthed with distances
cobbling his feet into gold
the llama of scrupulous eye
the widens his gaze on the dews
of a delicate world
A monkey is weaving
a thread of insatiable lusts
on the margins of morning
he topples a pollen-fall
startles the violet-flght
of the butterfly wings on the Muzo
It was the night of the alligator
snouts moving out of the slime
in original darkness the pullulations
a clatter of armour opaque
in the sleep of the bog
turning back to the chalk of the sources
The jaguar touches the leaves
with his phosphorous absence
the puma speeds to his covert
in the blaze of his hungers
his eyeballs a jungle of alcohol
burn in his head
