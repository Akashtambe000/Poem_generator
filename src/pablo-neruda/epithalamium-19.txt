Do you remember when
in winter
we reached the island
The sea raised toward us
a crown of cold
On the walls the climbing vines
murmured letting
dark leaves fall
as we passed
You too were a little leaf
that trembled on my chest
Life's wind put you there
At first I did not see you I did not know
that you were walking with me
until your roots
pierced my chest
joined the threads of my blood
spoke through my mouth
flourished with me
Thus was your inadvertent presence
invisible leaf or branch
and suddenly my heart was filled with fruits and sounds
You occupied the house
that darkly awaited you
and then you lit the lamps

the island of stone and moss
echoed in the secret of its grottoes
like the song in your mouth
and the flower that was born
between the crevices of the stone
with its secret syllable
spole as it passed your name
of blazing plant
and the steep rock raised
like the wall of the world
knew my song well beloved
and all things spoke of
your love my love beloved
because earth time sea island
life tide
the seed that half opens
its lips in the earth
the devouring flower
the movement of spring
everything recognizes us
Our love was born
outside the walls
in the wind
in the night
in the earth
and that's why the clay and the flower
the mud and the roots
know your name
and know that my mouth
joined yours
because we were sown together in the earth
and we alone did not know it
and that we grow together
and flower together
and therefore
when we pass
your name is on the petals
of the rose that grows on the stone
my name is in the grottoes
They know it all
we have no secrets
we have grown together
but we did not know it
The sea knows our love the stones
of the rocky height
know that our kisses flowered
with infinite purity
as in their crevices a scarlet
mouth dawns
just as our love and the kiss
that joins your mouth and mine
in an eternal flower
My love
sweet spring
flower and sea surround us
We did not change it
for our winter
when the wind
began to decipher your name
and today at all hours it repeats
when
the leaves did not know
that you were a leaf
when
the roots did not know that you were seeking me
in my breast
Love love
spring
offers us the sky
but the dark earth
is our name
our love belongs to all time and the earth
Loving each other my arm
beneath your neck of sand
we shall wait
as earth and time change
on the island
as the leaves fall
from the silent climbing vines
as autumn departs
through the broken window
But we
are going to wait for
our friend
our red-eyed friend
the fire
when the wind again
shakes the frontiers of the island
and does not know the names of everyone
winter
will seek us my love
always
it will seek us because we know it
because we do not fear it
because have
with us
fire
forever
spring with us
forever
and when a leaf
falls
from the climbing vines
you know my love
what name is written o
on that leaf
a names that is yours and mine
our love name a single
being the arrow
that pierced winter
the invincible love
the fire of the days
a leaf
that dropped upon my breast
a leaf from the tree
of life
that made a nest and sang
that put out roots
that gave flowers and fruits
And so you see my love
how I move around the island
around the world
safe in the midst of spring
crazy with light in the cold
walking tranquil in the fire
lifting your petal
weight in my arms
as if I had never walked
excpet with you my heart
as if I could not walk
except with you
as if I could not sing
except when you sing
