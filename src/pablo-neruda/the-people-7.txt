I recall that man and not two centuries
have passed since I saw him
he went neither by horse nor by carriage
purely on foot
he outstripped
distances
and carried no sword or armour
only nets on his shoulder
axe or hammer or spade
never fighting the rest of his species
his exploits were with water and earth
with wheat so that it turned into bread
with giant trees to render them wood
with walls to open up doors
with sand to construct the walls
and with ocean for it to bear
I knew him and he is still not cancelled in me
The carriages fell to pieces
war destroyed doors and walls
the city was a handful of ashes
all the clothes turned to dust
and he remains to me
he survives in the sand
when everything before
seemed imperishable but him
In the going and coming of families
at times he was my father or kinsman
or perhaps it was scarcely him or not
the one who did not return to his house
because water or earth swallowed him up
or a tree or an engine killed him
or he was the saddened carpenter
who went behind the coffin without tears
someone in the end who had no name
except those that metal or timber have
and on whom others gazed from on high
without seeing the ant
for the anthill
and so that when his feet did not stir
because the poor exhausted one had died
they never saw what they had not seen
already there were other feet where he'd been
The other feet were still his
and the other hands
the man remained
when it seemed that now he was done for
he was the same once more
there he was digging again at the earth
cutting cloth minus a shirt
there he was and was not like before
he had gone down and was once more
and since he never owned graveyards
or tombs nor was his name carved
on the stone he sweated to quarry
no one knew he had come
and no one knew when he died
so that only when the poor man could
he returned to life once more without it being noted
He was the man no doubt of it without heritage
without cattle without a flag
and he was not distinguished from others
the others who were him
from the heights he was grey like the subsoil
tanned like the leather
he was yellow reaping the wheat
he was black down in the mine
he was the colour of stone on the fortress
in the fishing boat the colour of tuna
and the colour of horses in the meadow
how could anyone distinguish him
if he was inseparable elemental
earth coal or sea vested in man
Where he lived whatever
a man touched grew
the hostile stones
quarried
by his hands
took on order
and one by one formed
the right clarity of a building
he made bread with his hands
moved the engines
the distances peopled themselves with towns
other men grew
bees arrived
and by man's creating and breeding
spring walked the market squares
between bakeries and doves
The maker of loaves was forgotten
he who quarried and journeyed beating down
and opening furrows transporting sand
when everything existed he no longer existed
he gave his existence that's all
He went elsewhere to labour and at last
he was dead rolling
like a stone in the river
death carried him downstream
I who knew him saw him descend
till he was no longer except what he left
roads he could scarcely know
houses he never ever would live in
I turn to see him and I await him
I see him in his grave and resurrected
I distinguish him among all
who are his equals
and it seems to me it cannot be
that like this we go nowhere
that to survive like this holds no glory
I believe that this man
must be enthroned rightly shod and crowned
I believe that those who made such things
must be the masters of all these things
And that those who made bread should eat
And those in the mines must have light
Enough now of grey men enslaved
Enough of the pale 'missing ones'
Not another man passes except as a king
Not a single woman without her crown
Golden gauntlets for every hand
Fruits of the sun for all the unknowns
I knew that man and when I could
when he still had eyes in his head
when he still had a voice in his mouth
I searched for him among tombs and I said
grasping his arm that was not yet dust
'All will be gone you will live on
You ignite life
You made what is yours.'
So let no one trouble themselves when
I seem to be alone and am not alone
I am with no one and speak for them all
Some listen to me without knowing
but those I sing those who do know
go on being born and will fill up the Earth
