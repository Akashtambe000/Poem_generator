Love a question
has destroyed you
I have come back to you
from thorny uncertainty
I want you straight as
the sword or the road
But you insist
on keeping a nook
of shadow that I do not want
My love
understand me
I love all of you
from eyes to feet to toenails
inside
all the brightness which you kept
It is I my love
who knocks at your door
It is not the ghost it is not
the one who once stopped
at your window
I knock down the door
I enter your life
I come to live in your soul
you cannot cope with me
You must open door to door
you must obey me
you must open your eyes
so that I may search in them
you must see how I walk
with heavy steps
along all the roads
that blind were waiting for me
Do not fear
I am yours
but
I am not the passenger or the beggar
I am your master
the one you were waiting for
and now I enter
your life
no more to leave it
love love love
but to stay
