I remember you as you were in the last autumn
You were the grey beret and the still heart
In your eyes the flames of the twilight fought on
And the leaves fell in the water of your soul
Clasping my arms like a climbing plant
the leaves garnered your voice that was slow and at peace
Bonfire of awe in which my thirst was burning
Sweet blue hyacinth twisted over my soul
I feel your eyes traveling and the autumn is far off
Grey beret voice of a bird heart like a house
Towards which my deep longings migrated
And my kisses fell happy as embers
Sky from a ship Field from the hills
Your memory is made of light of smoke of a still pond
Beyond your eyes farther on the evenings were blazing
Dry autumn leaves revolved in your soul
