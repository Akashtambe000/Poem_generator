Little
rose
roselet
at times
tiny and naked
it seems
as though you would fit
in one of my hands
as though I’ll clasp you like this
and carry you to my mouth
but
suddenly
my feet touch your feet and my mouth your lips
you have grown
your shoulders rise like two hills
your breasts wander over my breast
my arm scarcely manages to encircle the thin
new-moon line of your waist
in love you loosened yourself like sea water
I can scarcely measure the sky’s most spacious eyes
and I lean down to your mouth to kiss the earth
