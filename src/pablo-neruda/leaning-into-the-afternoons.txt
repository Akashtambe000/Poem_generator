Leaning into the afternoons I cast my sad nets
towards your oceanic eyes
There in the highest blaze my solitude lengthens and flames
its arms turning like a drowning man's
I send out red signals across your absent eyes
that smell like the sea or the beach by a lighthouse
You keep only darkness my distant female
from your regard sometimes the coast of dread emerges
Leaning into the afternoons I fling my sad nets
to that sea that is thrashed by your oceanic eyes
The birds of night peck at the first stars
that flash like my soul when I love you
The night gallops on its shadowy mare
shedding blue tassels over the land
