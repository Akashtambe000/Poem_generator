I touch hatred like a covered breast
I without stopping go from garment to garment
sleeping at a distance
I am not I'm of no use I do not know
anyone I have no weapons of ocean or wood
I do not live in this house
My mouth is full of night and water
The abiding moon determines
what I do not have
What I have is in the midst of the waves
a ray of water a day for myself
an iron depth
There is no cross-tide there is no shield no costume
there is no special solution too deep to be sounded
no vicious eyelid
I live suddenly and other times I follow
I touch a face suddenly and it murders me
I have no time
Do not look for me when drawing
the usual wild thread or the
bleeding net
Do not call me that is my occupation
Do not ask my name or my condition
Leave me in the middle of my own moon
in my wounded ground
