Arise to birth with me my brother
Give me your hand out of the depths
sown by your sorrows
You will not return from these stone fastnesses
You will not emerge from subterranean time
Your rasping voice will not come back
nor your pierced eyes rise from their sockets
Look at me from the depths of the earth
tiller of fields weaver reticent shepherd
groom of totemic guanacos
mason high on your treacherous scaffolding
iceman of Andean tears
jeweler with crushed fingers
farmer anxious among his seedlings
potter wasted among his clays
bring to the cup of this new life
your ancient buried sorrows
Show me your blood and your furrow
say to me here I was scourged
because a gem was dull or because the earth
failed to give up in time its tithe of corn or stone
Point out to me the rock on which you stumbled
the wood they used to crucify your body
Strike the old flints
to kindle ancient lamps light up the whips
glued to your wounds throughout the centuries
and light the axes gleaming with your blood
I come to speak for your dead mouths
Throughout the earth
let dead lips congregate
out of the depths spin this long night to me
as if I rode at anchor here with you
And tell me everything tell chain by chain
and link by link and step by step
sharpen the knives you kept hidden away
thrust them into my breast into my hands
like a torrent of sunbursts
an Amazon of buried jaguars
and leave me cry hours days and years
blind ages stellar centuries
And give me silence give me water hope
Give me the struggle the iron the volcanoes
Let bodies cling like magnets to my body
Come quickly to my veins and to my mouth
Speak through my speech and through my blood
