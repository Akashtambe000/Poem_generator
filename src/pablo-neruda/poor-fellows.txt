What it takes on this planet
to make love to each other in peace
Everyone pries under your sheets
everyone interferes with your loving
They say terrible things about a man and a woman
who after much milling about
all sorts of compunctions
do something unique
they both lie with each other in one bed
I ask myself whether frogs are so furtive
or sneeze as they please
Whether they whisper to each other in swamps about illegitimate frogs
or the joys of amphibious living
I ask myself if birds single out enemy birds
or bulls gossip with bullocks before they go out in public with cows
Even the roads have eyes and the parks their police
Hotels spy on their guests
windows name names
canons and squadrons debark on missions to liquidate love
All those ears and those jaws working incessantly
till a man and his girl
have to raise their climax
full tilt
on a bicycle
