Mara Mori brought me
a pair of socks
which she knitted herself
with her sheepherder's hands
two socks as soft as rabbits
I slipped my feet into them
as if they were two cases
knitted with threads of twilight and goatskin
Violent socks
my feet were two fish made of wool
two long sharks
sea blue shot through
by one golden thread
two immense blackbirds
two cannons
my feet were honored in this way
by these heavenly socks
They were so handsome for the first time
my feet seemed to me unacceptable
like two decrepit firemen
firemen unworthy of that woven fire
of those glowing socks
Nevertheless I resisted the sharp temptation
to save them somewhere as schoolboys
keep fireflies
as learned men collect
sacred texts
I resisted the mad impulse to put them
in a golden cage and each day give them
birdseed and pieces of pink melon
Like explorers in the jungle
who hand over the very rare green deer
to the spit and eat it with remorse
I stretched out my feet and pulled on
the magnificent socks and then my shoes
The moral of my ode is this
beauty is twice beauty
and what is good is doubly good
when it is a matter of two socks
made of wool in winter
