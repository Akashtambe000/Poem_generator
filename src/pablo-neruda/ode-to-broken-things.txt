Things get broken
at home
like they were pushed
by an invisible deliberate smasher
It's not my hands
or yours
It wasn't the girls
with their hard fingernails
or the motion of the planet
It wasn't anything or anybody
It wasn't the wind
It wasn't the orange-colored noontime
Or night over the earth
It wasn't even the nose or the elbow
Or the hips getting bigger
or the ankle
or the air
The plate broke the lamp fell
All the flower pots tumbled over
one by one That pot
which overflowed with scarlet
in the middle of October
it got tired from all the violets
and another empty one
rolled round and round and round
all through winter
until it was only the powder
of a flowerpot
a broken memory shining dust
And that clock
whose sound
was
the voice of our lives
the secret
thread of our weeks
which released
one by one so many hours
for honey and silence
for so many births and jobs
that clock also
fell
and its delicate blue guts
vibrated
among the broken glass
its wide heart
unsprung
Life goes on grinding up
glass wearing out clothes
making fragments
breaking down
forms
and what lasts through time
is like an island on a ship in the sea
perishable
surrounded by dangerous fragility
by merciless waters and threats
Let's put all our treasures together
 the clocks plates cups cracked by the cold 
into a sack and carry them
to the sea
and let our possessions sink
into one alarming breaker
that sounds like a river
May whatever breaks
be reconstructed by the sea
with the long labor of its tides
So many useless things
which nobody broke
but which got broken anyway
