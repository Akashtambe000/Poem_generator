An odor has remained among the sugarcane
a mixture of blood and body a penetrating
petal that brings nausea
Between the coconut palms the graves are full
of ruined bones of speechless death-rattles
The delicate dictator is talking
with top hats gold braid and collars
The tiny palace gleams like a watch
and the rapid laughs with gloves on
cross the corridors at times
and join the dead voices
and the blue mouths freshly buried
The weeping cannot be seen like a plant
whose seeds fall endlessly on the earth
whose large blind leaves grow even without light
Hatred has grown scale on scale
blow on blow in the ghastly water of the swamp
with a snout full of ooze and silence
