I have scarcely left you
When you go in me crystalline
Or trembling
Or uneasy wounded by me
Or overwhelmed with love as
when your eyes
Close upon the gift of life
That without cease I give you
My love
We have found each other
Thirsty and we have
Drunk up all the water and the
Blood
We found each other
Hungry
And we bit each other
As fire bites
Leaving wounds in us
But wait for me
Keep for me your sweetness
I will give you too
A rose
