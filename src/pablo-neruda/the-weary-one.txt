The weary one orphan
of the masses the self
the crushed one the one made of concrete
the one without a country in crowded restaurants
he who wanted to go far away always farther away
didn't know what to do there whether he wanted
or didn't want to leave or remain on the island
the hesitant one the hybrid entangled in himself
had no place here the straight-angled stone
the infinite look of the granite prism
the circular solitude all banished him
he went somewhere else with his sorrows
he returned to the agony of his native land
to his indecisions of winter and summer
