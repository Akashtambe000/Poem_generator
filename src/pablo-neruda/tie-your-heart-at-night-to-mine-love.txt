Tie your heart at night to mine love
and both will defeat the darkness
like twin drums beating in the forest
against the heavy wall of wet leaves
Night crossing black coal of dream
that cuts the thread of earthly orbs
with the punctuality of a headlong train
that pulls cold stone and shadow endlessly
Love because of it tie me to a purer movement
to the grip on life that beats in your breast
with the wings of a submerged swan
So that our dream might reply
to the sky's questioning stars
with one key one door closed to shadow
