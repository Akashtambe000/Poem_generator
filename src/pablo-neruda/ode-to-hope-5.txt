Oceanic dawn
at the center
of my life
waves like grapes
the sky's solitude
you fill me
and flood
the complete sea
the undiminished sky
tempo
and space
sea foam's white
battalions
the orange earth
the sun's
fiery waist
in agony
so many
gifts and talents
birds soaring into their dreams
and the sea the sea
suspended
aroma
chorus of rich resonant salt
and meanwhile
we men
touch the water
struggling
and hoping
we touch the sea
hoping
And the waves tell the firm coast
'Everything will be fulfilled.'
