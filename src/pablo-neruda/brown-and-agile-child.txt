Brown and agile child the sun which forms the fruit
And ripens the grain and twists the seaweed
Has made your happy body and your luminous eyes
And given your mouth the smile of water
A black and anguished sun is entangled in the twigs
Of your black mane when you hold out your arms
You play in the sun as in a tidal river
And it leaves two dark pools in your eyes
Brown and agile child nothing draws me to you
Everything pulls away from me here in the noon
You are the delirious youth of bee
The drunkedness of the wave the power of the wheat
My somber heart seeks you always
I love your happy body your rich soft voice
Dusky butterfly sweet and sure
Like the wheatfiled the sun the poppy and the water
