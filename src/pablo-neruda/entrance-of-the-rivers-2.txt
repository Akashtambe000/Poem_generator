Beloved of the rivers,beset
By azure water and transparent drops
Like a tree of veins your spectre
Of dark goddess biting apples
And then awakening naked
To be tattoed by the rivers
And in the wet heights your head
Filled the world with new dew
Water rose to your waist
You are made of wellsprings
And lakes shone on your forehead
From your sources of density you drew
Water like vital tears
And hauled the riverbeds to the sand
Across the planetary night
Crossing rough dilated stone
Breaking down on the way
All the salt of geology
Cutting through forests of compact walls
Dislodging the muscles of quartz
