Maybe you'll remember that razor-faced man
who slipped out from the dark like a blade
and  before we realized  knew what was there
he saw the smoke and concluded fire
The pallid woman with black hair
rose like a fish from the abyss
and the two of them built up a contraption
armed to the teeth against love
Man and woman they felled mountains and gardens
then went down to the river they scaled the walls
they hoisted their atrocious artillery up the hill
Then love knew it was called love
And when I lifted my eyes to your name
suddenly your heart showed me my way
