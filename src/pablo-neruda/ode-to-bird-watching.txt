Now
Let's look for birds
The tall iron branches
in the forest
The dense
fertility on the ground
The world
is wet
A dewdrop or raindrop
shines
a diminutive star
among the leaves
The morning time
mother earth
is cool
The air
is like a river
which shakes
the silence
It smells of rosemary
of space
and roots
Overhead
a crazy song
It's a bird
How
out of its throat
smaller than a finger
can there fall the waters
of its song
Luminous ease
Invisible
power
torrent
of music
in the leaves
Sacred conversations
Clean and fresh washed
is this
day resounding
like a green dulcimer
I bury
my shoes
in the mud
jump over rivulets
A thorn
bites me and a gust
of air like a crystal
wave
splits up inside my chest
Where
are the birds
Maybe it was
that
rustling in the foliage
or that fleeting pellet
of brown velvet
or that displaced
perfume That
leaf that let loose cinnamon smell
 was that a bird That dust
from an irritated magnolia
or that fruit
which fell with a thump 
was that a flight
Oh invisible little
critters
birds of the devil
with their ringing
with their useless feathers
I only want
to caress them
to see them resplendent
I don't want
to see under glass
the embalmed lightning
I want to see them living
I want to touch their gloves
of real hide
which they never forget in
the branches
and to converse with
them
sitting on my shoulders
although they may leave
me like certain statues
undeservedly whitewashed
Impossible
You can't touch them
You can hear them
like a heavenly
rustle or movement
They converse
with precision
They repeat
their observations
They brag
of how much they do
They comment
on everything that exists
They learn
certain sciences
like hydrography
and by a sure science
they know
where there are harvests
of grain
