Our Father thou art in Heaven
in water in air
in all our silent and broad latitude
everything bears your name Father in our dwelling
your name raises sweetness in sugar cane
Bolivar tin has a Bolivar gleam
the Bolívar bird flies over the Bolivar volcano
the potato the saltpeter the special shadows
the brooks the phosphorous stone veins
everything comes from your extinguished life
your legacy was rivers plains bell towers
your legacy is our daily bread oh Father
