To whoever is not listening to the sea
this Friday morning to whoever is cooped up
in house or office factory or woman
or street or mine or harsh prison cell
to him I come and without speaking or looking
I arrive and open the door of his prison
and a vibration starts up vague and insistent
a great fragment of thunder sets in motion
the rumble of the planet and the foam
the raucous rivers of the ocean flood
the star vibrates swiftly in its corona
and the sea is beating dying and continuing
So drawn on by my destiny
I ceaselessly must listen to and keep
the sea's lamenting in my awareness
I must feel the crash of the hard water
and gather it up in a perpetual cup
so that wherever those in prison may be
wherever they suffer the autumn's castigation
I may be there with an errant wave
I may move passing through windows
and hearing me eyes will glance upward
saying 'How can I reach the sea?'
And I shall broadcast saying nothing
the starry echoes of the wave
a breaking up of foam and quicksand
a rustling of salt withdrawing
the grey cry of the sea-birds on the coast
So through me freedom and the sea
will make their answer to the shuttered heart
