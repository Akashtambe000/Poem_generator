The gay young men and the love-sick girls
and the abandoned widows suffering in sleepless delirium
and the young pregnant wives of thirty hours
and the raucous cats that cruise my garden in the shadows
like a necklace of pulsating oysters of sex
surround my lonely residence
like enemies lined up against my soul
like conspirators in bedroom clothes
who exchange long deep kisses to order
The radiant summer leads to lovers
in predictable melancholic regiments
made of fat and skinny sad and happy pairings
under the elegant coconut palms near the ocean and the moon
goes an endless movement of trousers and dresses
a whisper of silk stockings being caressed
and womens breasts that sparkle like eyes
The little employee after it all
after the weeks boredom and novels read by night in bed
has definitively seduced the girl next door
and carried her away to a run-down movie house
where the heroes are studs or princes mad with passion
and strokes her legs covered with soft down
with his moist and ardent hands that smell of cigarettes
The seducers afternoons and married peoples nights
come together like the sheets and bury me
and the hours after lunch when the young male students
and the young girl students and the priests masturbate
and the creatures fornicate outright
and the bees smell of blood and the flies madly buzz
and boy and girl cousins play oddly together
and doctors stare in fury at the young patients husband
and the morning hours in which the professor as if to pass the time
performs his marriage duties and breakfasts
and moreover the adulterers who love each other truly
on beds as high and deep as ocean liners
finally eternally surrounding me
is a gigantic forest breathing and tangled
with gigantic flowers like mouths with teeth
and black roots in the shape of hooves and shoes
