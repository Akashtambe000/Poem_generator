All those men were there inside
when she came in totally naked
They had been drinking they began to spit
Newly come from the river she knew nothing
She was a mermaid who had lost her way
The insults flowed down her gleaming flesh
Obscenities drowned her golden breasts
Not knowing tears she did not weep tears
Not knowing clothes she did not have clothes
They blackened her with burnt corks and cigarette stubs
and rolled around laughing on the tavern floor
She did not speak because she had no speech
Her eyes were the colour of distant love
her twin arms were made of white topaz
Her lips moved silent in a coral light
and suddenly she went out by that door
Entering the river she was cleaned
shining like a white stone in the rain
and without looking back she swam again
swam towards emptiness swam towards death
