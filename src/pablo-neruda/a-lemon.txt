Out of lemon flowers
loosed
on the moonlight love's
lashed and insatiable
essences
sodden with fragrance
the lemon tree's yellow
emerges
the lemons
move down
from the tree's planetarium
Delicate merchandise
The harbors are big with it
bazaars
for the light and the
barbarous gold
We open
the halves
of a miracle
and a clotting of acids
brims
into the starry
divisions
creation's
original juices
irreducible changeless
alive
so the freshness lives on
in a lemon
in the sweet-smelling house of the rind
the proportions arcane and acerb
Cutting the lemon
the knife
leaves a little cathedral
alcoves unguessed by the eye
that open acidulous glass
to the light topazes
riding the droplets
altars
aromatic facades
So while the hand
holds the cut of the lemon
half a world
on a trencher
the gold of the universe
wells
to your touch
a cup yellow
with miracles
a breast and a nipple
perfuming the earth
a flashing made fruitage
the diminutive fire of a planet
