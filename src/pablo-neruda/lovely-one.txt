Lovely one
Just as on the cool stone
Of the spring the water
Opens a wide flash of foam
So is the smile of your face
Lovely one
Lovely one
With delicate hands and slender feet
Like a silver pony
Walking flower of the world
Thus I see you
Lovely one
Lovely one
With a nest of copper entangled
On your head a nest
The coloUr of dark honey
Where my heart burns and rests
Lovely one
Lovely one
Your eyes are too big for your face
Your eyes are too big for the earth
There are countries there are rivers
In your eyes
My country is your eyes
I walk through them
They light the world
Through which I walk
Lovely one
Lovely one
Your breasts are like two loaves made
Of grainy earth and golden moon
Lovely one
Lovely one
Your waist
My arm shaped it like a river when
It flowed a thousand years through your sweet body
Lovely one
Lovely one
There is nothing like your hips
Perhaps earth has
In some hidden place
The curve and the fragrance of your body
Perhaps in some place
Lovely one
Lovely one my lovely one
Your voice your skin your nails
Lovely one my lovely one
Your being your light your shadow
Lovely one
All that is mine lovely one
All that is mine my dear
When you walk or rest
When you sing or sleep
When you suffer or dream
Always
When you are near or far
Always
You are mine my lovely one
Always
