From your hips down to your feet
I want to make a long journey
I am smaller than an insect
Over these hills I pass
hills the colour of oats
crossed with faint tracks
that only I know
scorched centimetres
pale perspectives
Now here is a mountain
I shall never leave this
What a giant growth of moss
And a crater a rose
of moist fire
Coming down your legs
I trace a spiral
or sleep on the way
and arrive at your knees
round hardness
like the hard peaks
of a bright continent
Sliding down to your feet
I reach the eight slits
of your pointed slow
peninsular toes
and from them I fall down
to the white emptiness
of the sheet seeking blindly
and hungrily the form
of your fiery crucible
