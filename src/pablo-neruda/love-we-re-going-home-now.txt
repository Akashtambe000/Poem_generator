Love we're going home now
Where the vines clamber over the trellis
Even before you the summer will arrive
On its honeysuckle feet in your bedroom
Our nomadic kisses wandered over all the world
Armenia dollop of disinterred honey
Ceylon green dove and the YangTse with its old
Old patience dividing the day from the night
And now dearest we return across the crackling sea
Like two blind birds to their wall
To their nest in a distant spring
Because love cannot always fly without resting
Our lives return to the wall to the rocks of the sea
Our kisses head back home where they belong
