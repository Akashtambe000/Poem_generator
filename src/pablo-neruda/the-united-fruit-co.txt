When the trumpet sounded it was
all prepared on the earth
the Jehovah parcelled out the earth
to Coca Cola Inc. Anaconda
Ford Motors and other entities
The Fruit Company Inc
reserved for itself the most succulent
the central coast of my own land
the delicate waist of America
It rechristened its territories
as the ’Banana Republics’
and over the sleeping dead
over the restless heroes
who brought about the greatness the liberty and the flags
it established the comic opera
abolished the independencies
presented crowns of Caesar
unsheathed envy attracted
the dictatorship of the flies
Trujillo flies Tacho flies
Carias flies Martines flies
Ubico flies damp flies
of modest blood and marmalade
drunken flies who zoom
over the ordinary graves
circus flies wise flies
well trained in tyranny
Among the blood-thirsty flies
the Fruit Company lands its ships
taking off the coffee and the fruit
the treasure of our submerged
territories flow as though
on plates into the ships
Meanwhile Indians are falling
into the sugared chasms
of the harbours wrapped
for burials in the mist of the dawn
a body rolls a thing
that has no name a fallen cipher
a cluster of the dead fruit
thrown down on the dump
