I like you calm as if you were absent
and you hear me far-off and my voice does not touch you
It seems that your eyelids have taken to flying
it seems that a kiss has sealed up your mouth
Since all these things are filled with my spirit
you come from things filled with my spirit
You appear as my soul as the butterfly’s dreaming
and you appear as Sadness’s word
I like you calm as if you were distant
you are a moaning a butterfly’s cooing
You hear me far-off my voice does not reach you
Let me be calmed then calmed by your silence
Let me commune then commune with your silence
clear as a light and pure as a ring
You are like night calmed constellated
Your silence is star-like as distant as true
I like you calm as if you were absent
distant and saddened as if you were dead
One word at that moment a smile is sufficient
And I thrill then I thrill that it cannot be so
XV From:’ Veinte poemas de amor’
I like you calm as if you were absent
and you hear me far-off and my voice does not touch you
It seems that your eyelids have taken to flying
it seems that a kiss has sealed up your mouth
Since all these things are filled with my spirit
you come from things filled with my spirit
You appear as my soul as the butterfly’s dreaming
and you appear as Sadness’s word
I like you calm as if you were distant
you are a moaning a butterfly’s cooing
You hear me far-off my voice does not reach you
Let me be calmed then calmed by your silence
Let me commune then commune with your silence
clear as a light and pure as a ring
You are like night calmed constellated
Your silence is star-like as distant as true
I like you calm as if you were absent
distant and saddened as if you were dead
One word at that moment a smile is sufficient
And I thrill then I thrill that it cannot be so
