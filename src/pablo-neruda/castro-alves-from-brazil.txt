Castro Alves from Brazil for whom did you sing
Did you sing for the flower For the water
whose beauty whispered words to the stones
Did you sing to the eyes to the torn profile
of the woman you once loved For the spring
Yes but those petals were not dewed
those black waters had no words
those eyes were those who saw death
still burning the tortures behind love
Spring was splashed with blood
I sang for the slaves aboard the ships
as a dark branch of wrath
They travelled and bled from the ships
leaving us the weight of a stolen blood
I sang in those days against the inferno
against the sharp languages of greed
against the gold drenched in the torment
against the hand that rose the whip
against the maestros of darkness
Each rose had one dead man in their roots
The light the night the sky were covered in tears
the eyes separated from wounded hands
and it was my voice the only one to fill the silence
I wanted that from the man we could be rescued
I believed that the route passed through the man
and from there destiny would be made
I sang for those who had no voice
My voice hit doors that until then were closed
so that fighting Freedom could be let in
Castro Alves from Brazil now that your pure book
is reborn to a free land
let me poet of our America
to crown your head with the laurels of the people
Your voice joined the eternal and loud voice of the men
You sang well You sang how it must be sung
