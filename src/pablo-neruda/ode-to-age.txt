I don't believe in age
All old people
carry
in their eyes
a child
and children
at times
observe us with the
eyes of wise ancients
Shall we measure
life
in meters or kilometers
or months
How far since you were born
How long
must you wander
until
like all men
instead of walking on its surface
we rest below the earth
To the man to the woman
who utilized their
energies goodness strength
anger love tenderness
to those who truly
alive
flowered
and in their sensuality matured
let us not apply
the measure
of a time
that may be
something else a mineral
mantle a solar
bird a flower
something maybe
but not a measure
Time metal
or bird long
petiolate flower
stretch
through
man's life
shower him
with blossoms
and with
bright
water
or with hidden sun
I proclaim you
road
not shroud
a pristine
ladder
with treads
of air
a suit lovingly
renewed
through springtimes
around the world
Now
time I roll you up
I deposit you in my
bait box
and I am off to fish
with your long line
the fishes of the dawn
translated from the Spanish by Margaret Sayers Peden
