Victory It has come late I had not learnt
how to arrive like the lily at will
the white figure that pierces
the motionless eternity of earth
pushing at clear faint form
till the hour strikes that clay
with a white ray or a spur of milk
Shedding of clothing the thick darkness of soil
on whose cliff the fair flower advances
till the flag of its whiteness
defeats the contemptible deep of night
and from the motion of light
spills itself in astonished seed
