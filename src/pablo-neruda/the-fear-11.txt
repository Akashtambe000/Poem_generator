They all ask me to jump
to invigorate and to play soccer
to run to swim and to fly
Very well
They all advise me rest
they all send me to the doctor
looking at me a certain way
What happens
They all advise me to travel
to come and to leave to stay
to die and not to die
It does not matter
They all see the difficulties
of my surprised bowels
by awful X-rayed portraits
I do not agree
They all sting my poetry
with relentless forks
seeking without doubt a fly
I Am afraid
I am afraid of everyone
of the cold water of the death
I am like all the mortals
unavoidable
And for that in these short days
I am not going to pay attention to them
I am going to open myself up and shut myself in
with my more perfidious enemy
Pablo Neruda
