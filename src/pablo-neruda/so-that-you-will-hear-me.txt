So that you will hear me
my words
sometimes grow thin
as the tracks of the gulls on the beaches
Necklace drunken bell
for your hands smooth as grapes
And I watch my words from a long way off
They are more yours than mine
They climb on my old suffering like ivy
It climbs the same way on damp walls
You are to blame for this cruel sport
They are fleeing from my dark lair
You fill everything you fill everything
Before you they peopled the solitude that you occupy
and they are more used to my sadness than you are
Now I want them to say what I want to say to you
to make you hear as I want you to hear me
The wind of anguish still hauls on them as usual
Sometimes hurricanes of dreams still knock them over
You listen to other voices in my painful voice
Lament of old mouths blood of old supplications
Love me companion Don't forsake me Follow me
Follow me companion on this wave of anguish
But my words become stained with your love
You occupy everything you occupy everything
I am making them into an endless necklace
for your white hands smooth as grapes
