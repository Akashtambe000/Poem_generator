Who ever desired each other as we do Let us look
for the ancient ashes of hearts that burned
and let our kisses touch there one by one
till the flower disembodied rises again
Let us love that Desire that consumed its own fruit
and went down aspect and power into the earth
We are its continuing light
its indestructible fragile seed
