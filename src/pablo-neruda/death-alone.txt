There are lone cemeteries
tombs full of soundless bones
the heart threading a tunnel
a dark dark tunnel 
like a wreck we die to the very core
as if drowning at the heart
or collapsing inwards from skin to soul
There are corpses
clammy slabs for feet
there is death in the bones
like a pure sound
a bark without its dog
out of certain bells certain tombs
swelling in this humidity like lament or rain
I see when alone at times
coffins under sail
setting out with the pale dead women in their dead braids
bakers as white as angels
thoughtful girls married to notaries
coffins ascending the vertical river of the dead
the wine-dark river to its source
with their sails swollen with the sound of death
filled with the silent noise of death
Death is drawn to sound
like a slipper without a foot a suit without its wearer
comes to knock with a ring stoneless and fingerless
comes to shout without a mouth a tongue without a throat
Nevertheless its footsteps sound
and its clothes echo hushed like a tree
I do not know I am ignorant I hardly see
but it seems to me that its song has the colour of wet violets
violets well used to the earth
since the face of death is green
and the gaze of death green
with the etched moisture of a violet's leaf
and its grave colour of exasperated winter
But death goes about the earth also riding a broom
lapping the ground in search of the dead 
death is in the broom
it is the tongue of death looking for the dead
the needle of death looking for the thread
Death lies in our beds 
in the lazy mattresses the black blankets
lives a full stretch and then suddenly blows
blows sound unknown filling out the sheets
and there are beds sailing into a harbour
where death is waiting dressed as an admiral
