Fleas interest me so much
that I let them bite me for hours
They are perfect ancient Sanskrit
machines that admit of no appeal
They do not bite to eat
they bite only to jump
they are the dancers of the celestial sphere
delicate acrobats
in the softest and most profound circus
let them gallop on my skin
divulge their emotions
amuse themselves with my blood
but someone should introduce them to me
I want to know them closely
I want to know what to rely on
