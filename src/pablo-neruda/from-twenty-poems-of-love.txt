I can write the saddest lines tonight

Write for example ‘The night is fractured
and they shiver blue those stars in the distance’

The night wind turns in the sky and sings
I can write the saddest lines tonight
I loved her sometimes she loved me too

On nights like these I held her in my arms
I kissed her greatly under the infinite sky

She loved me sometimes I loved her too
How could I not have loved her huge still eyes

I can write the saddest lines tonight
To think I don’t have her to feel I have lost her

Hear the vast night vaster without her
Lines fall on the soul like dew on the grass

What does it matter that I couldn’t keep her
The night is fractured and she is not with me

That is all Someone sings far off Far off
my soul is not content to have lost her

As though to reach her my sight looks for her
My heart looks for her she is not with me


The same night whitens in the same branches
We from that time we are not the same

I don’t love her that’s certain but how I loved her
My voice tried to find the breeze to reach her

Another’s kisses on her like my kisses
Her voice her bright body infinite eyes

I don’t love her that’s certain but perhaps I love her
Love is brief forgetting lasts so long

Since on these nights I held her in my arms
my soul is not content to have lost her

Though this is the last pain she will make me suffer
and these are the last lines I will write for her
