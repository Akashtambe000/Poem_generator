Naked you are simple as one of your hands
Smooth earthy small transparent round
You have moonlines applepathways
Naked you are slender as a naked grain of wheat
Naked you are blue as the night in Cuba
You have vines and stars in your hair
Naked you are spacious and yellow
As summer in a golden church
Naked you are tiny as one of your nails
Curved subtle rosy till the day is born
And you withdraw to the underground world
as if down a long tunnel of clothing and of chores
Your clear light dims gets dressed drops its leaves
And becomes a naked hand again
