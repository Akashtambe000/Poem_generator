Come with me I said and no one knew
where or how my pain throbbed
no carnations or barcaroles for me
only a wound that love had opened
I said it again Come with me as if I were dying
and no one saw the moon that bled in my mouth
or the blood that rose into the silence
O Love now we can forget the star that has such thorns
That is why when I heard your voice repeat
Come with me it was as if you had let loose
the grief the love the fury of a cork-trapped wine
the geysers flooding from deep in its vault
in my mouth I felt the taste of fire again
of blood and carnations of rock and scald
