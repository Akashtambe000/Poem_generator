Three triangles of birds crossed
Over the enormous ocean which extended
In winter like a green beast
Everything just lay there the silence
The unfolding gray the heavy light
Of space some land now and then
Over everything there was passing
A flight
And another flight
Of dark birds winter bodies
Trembling triangles
Whose wings
Frantically flapping hardly
Can carry the gray cold the desolate days
From one place to another
Along the coast of Chile
I am here while from one sky to another
The trembling of the migratory birds
Leaves me sunk inside myself inside my own matter
Like an everlasting well
Dug by an immovable spiral
Now they have disappeared
Black feathers of the sea
Iron birds
From steep slopes and rock piles
Now at noon
I am in front of emptiness It’s a winter
Space stretched out
And the sea has put
Over its blue face
A bitter mask
