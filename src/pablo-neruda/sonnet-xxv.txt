Before I loved you love nothing was my own
I wavered through the streets among
Objects
Nothing mattered or had a name
The world was made of air which waited
I knew rooms full of ashes
Tunnels where the moon lived
Rough warehouses that growled 'get lost'
Questions that insisted in the sand
Everything was empty dead mute
Fallen abandoned and decayed
Inconceivably alien it all
Belonged to someone else  to no one
Till your beauty and your poverty
Filled the autumn plentiful with gifts
