Your whole body has
a fullness or a gentleness destined for me
When I move my hand up
I find in each place a dove
that was seeking me as
if they had love made you of clay
for my own potter's hands
Your knees your breasts
your waist
are missing parts of me like the hollow
of a thirsty earth
from which they broke off
a form
and together
we are complete like a single river
like a single grain of sand
