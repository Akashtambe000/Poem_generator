There where the waves shatter on the restless rocks
the clear light bursts and enacts its rose
and the sea-circle shrinks to a cluster of buds
to one drop of blue salt falling
O bright magnolia bursting in the foam
magnetic transient whose death blooms
and vanishes--being nothingness--forever
broken salt dazzling lurch of the sea
You  I Love together we ratify the silence
while the sea destroys its perpetual statues
collapses its towers of wild speed and whiteness
because in the weavings of those invisible fabrics
galloping water incessant sand
we make the only permanent tenderness
