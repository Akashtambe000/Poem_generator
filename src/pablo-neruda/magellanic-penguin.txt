Neither clown nor child nor black
nor white but verticle
and a questioning innocence
dressed in night and snow
The mother smiles at the sailor
the fisherman at the astronaunt
but the child child does not smile
when he looks at the bird child
and from the disorderly ocean
the immaculate passenger
emerges in snowy mourning
I was without doubt the child bird
there in the cold archipelagoes
when it looked at me with its eyes
with its ancient ocean eyes
it had neither arms nor wings
but hard little oars
on its sides
it was as old as the salt
the age of moving water
and it looked at me from its age
since then I know I do not exist
I am a worm in the sand
the reasons for my respect
remained in the sand
the religious bird
did not need to fly
did not need to sing
and through its form was visible
its wild soul bled salt
as if a vein from the bitter sea
had been broken
Penguin static traveler
deliberate priest of the cold
I salute your vertical salt
and envy your plumed pride
