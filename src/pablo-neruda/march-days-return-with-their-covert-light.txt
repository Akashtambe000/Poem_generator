March days return with their covert light
and huge fish swim through the sky
vague earthly vapours progress in secret
things slip to silence one by one
Through fortuity at this crisis of errant skies
you reunite the lives of the sea to that of fire
grey lurchings of the ship of winter
to the form that love carved in the guitar
O love O rose soaked by mermaids and spume
dancing flame that climbs the invisible stairway
to waken the blood in insomnia’s labyrinth
so that the waves can complete themselves in the sky
the sea forget its cargoes and rages
and the world fall into darkness’s nets
