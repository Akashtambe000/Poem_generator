It was passed from one bird to another
the whole gift of the day
The day went from flute to flute
went dressed in vegetation
in flights which opened a tunnel
through the wind would pass
to where birds were breaking open
the dense blue air 
and there night came in
When I returned from so many journeys
I stayed suspended and green
between sun and geography 
I saw how wings worked
how perfumes are transmitted
by feathery telegraph
and from above I saw the path
the springs and the roof tiles
the fishermen at their trades
the trousers of the foam
I saw it all from my green sky
I had no more alphabet
than the swallows in their courses
the tiny shining water
of the small bird on fire
which dances out of the pollen
