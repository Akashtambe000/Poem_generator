Today is that day the day that carried
a desperate light that since has died
Don't let the squatters know
let's keep it all between us
day between your bell
and my secret
Today is dead winter in the forgotten land
that comes to visit me with a cross on the map
and a volcano in the snow to return to me
to return again the water
fallen on the roof of my childhood
Today when the sun began with its shafts
to tell the story so clear so old
the slanting rain fell like a sword
the rain my hard heart welcomes
You my love still asleep in August
my queen my woman my vastness my geography
kiss of mud the carbon-coated zither
you vestment of my persistent song
today you are reborn again and with the sky's
black water confuse me and compel me
I must renew my bones in your kingdom
I must still uncloud my earthly duties
