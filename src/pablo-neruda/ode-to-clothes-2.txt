Every morning you wait
clothes over a chair
to fill yourself with
my vanity my love
my hope my body
Barely
risen from sleep
I relinquish the water
enter your sleeves
my legs look for
the hollows of your legs
and so embraced
by your indefatigable faithfulness
I rise to tread the grass
enter poetry
consider through the windows
the things
the men the women
the deeds and the fights
go on forming me
go on making me face things
working my hands
opening my eyes
using my mouth
and so
clothes
I too go forming you
extending your elbows
snapping your threads
and so your life expands
in the image of my life
In the wind
you billow and snap
as if you were my soul
at bad times
you cling
to my bones
vacant for the night
darkness sleep
populate with their phantoms
your wings and mine
I wonder
if one day
a bullet
from the enemy
will leave you stained with my blood
and then
you will die with me
or one day
not quite
so dramatic
but simple
you will fall ill
clothes
with me
grow old
with me with my body
and joined
we will enter
the earth
Because of this
each day
I greet you
with reverence and then
you embrace me and I forget you
because we are one
and we will go on
facing the wind in the night
the streets or the fight
a single body
one day one day some day still
