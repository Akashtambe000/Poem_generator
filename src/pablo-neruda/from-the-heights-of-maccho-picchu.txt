Rise up to be born with me brother
Give me your hand from the deep
Zone seeded by your sorrow
You won’t return from under the rocks
You won’t return from your subterranean time
Your hardened voice won’t return
Your gouged-out eyes won’t return
Look at me from the depth of the earth
laborer weaver silent shepherd
tamer of wild llamas like spirit images
construction worker on a daring scaffold
waterer of the tears of the Andes
jeweler with broken fingers
farmer trembling as you sow
potter poured out into your clay
bring to the cup of this new life
your old buried sorrows
Show me your blood and your furrow
Tell me “Here I was punished
Because the jewel didn’t shine or the earth
Didn’t yield grain or stones on time.”
Show me the stone you fell over
And the wood on which they crucified you
Make a spark from the old flints for me
For the old lamps to show the whips still stuck
After centuries in the old wounds
And the axes shining with blood
I come to speak for your dead mouth
Across the earth come together all
The silent worn-out lips
And from the depth speak to me all this long night
Like I was pinned down there with you
Tell me all chain by chain
Link by link and step by step
Sharpen the knives which you hid
Put them in my breast and in my hand
Like a river of yellow lighting
Like a river of buried jaguars
And let me weep hours days years
For blind ages cycles of stars
Give me silence water hope
Give me struggle iron volcanoes
Stick bodies to me like magnets
Draw near to my veins and my mouth
Speak through my words and my blood
