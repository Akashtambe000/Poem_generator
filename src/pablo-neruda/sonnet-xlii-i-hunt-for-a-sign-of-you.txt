I hunt for a sign of you in all the others
In the rapid undulant river of women
Braids shyly sinking eyes
Light step that slices sailing through the foam
Suddenly I think I can make out your nails
Oblong quick nieces of a cherry
Then it's your hair that passes by and I think
I see your image a bonfire burning in the water
I searched but no one else had your rhythms
Your light the shady day you brought from the forest
Nobody had your tiny ears
You are whole exact and everything you are is one
And so I go along with you I float along loving
A wide Mississippi toward a feminine sea
