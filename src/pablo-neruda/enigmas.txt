You've asked me what the lobster is weaving there with
his golden feet
I reply the ocean knows this
You say what is the ascidia waiting for in its transparent
bell What is it waiting for
I tell you it is waiting for time like you
You ask me whom the Macrocystis alga hugs in its arms
Study study it at a certain hour in a certain sea I know
You question me about the wicked tusk of the narwhal
and I reply by describing
how the sea unicorn with the harpoon in it dies
You enquire about the kingfisher's feathers
which tremble in the pure springs of the southern tides
Or you've found in the cards a new question touching on
the crystal architecture
of the sea anemone and you'll deal that to me now
You want to understand the electric nature of the ocean
spines
The armored stalactite that breaks as it walks
The hook of the angler fish the music stretched out
in the deep places like a thread in the water

I want to tell you the ocean knows this that life in its
jewel boxes
is endless as the sand impossible to count pure
and among the blood-colored grapes time has made the
petal
hard and shiny made the jellyfish full of light
and untied its knot letting its musical threads fall
from a horn of plenty made of infinite mother-of-pearl
I am nothing but the empty net which has gone on ahead
of human eyes dead in those darknesses
of fingers accustomed to the triangle longitudes
on the timid globe of an orange
I walked around as you do investigating
the endless star
and in my net during the night I woke up naked
the only thing caught a fish trapped inside the wind
