O tower of light sad beauty
that magnified necklaces and statues in the sea
calcareous eye insignia of the vast waters cry
of the mourning petrel tooth of the sea wife
of the Oceanian wind O separate rose
from the long stem of the trampled bush
that the depths converted into archipelago
O natural star green diadem
alone in your lonesome dynasty
still unattainable elusive desolate
like one drop like one grape like the sea
