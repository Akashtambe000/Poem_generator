Writing
these
odes
in this
year nineteen
hundred and
fifty-five
readying and tuning
my demanding murmuring lyre
I know who I am
and where my song is going
I understand
that the shopper for myths
and mysteries
may enter
my wood
and adobe
house of odes
may despise
the utensils
the portraits
of father and mother and country
on the walls
the simplicity
of the bread
and the saltcellar But
that's how it is in my house of odes
I deposed the dark monarchy
the useless flowing hair of dreams
I trod on the tail
of the cerebral reptile
and set things
 water and fire 
in harmony with man and earth
I want everything
to have
a handle
I want everything to be
a cup or a tool
I want people to enter a hardware
store through the door of my odes
I work at
cutting
newly hewn boards
storing casks
of honey
arranging
horseshoes harness
forks
I want everyone to enter here
let them ask questions
ask for anything they want
I am from the South a Chilean
a sailor
returned
from the seas
I did not stay in the islands
a king
I did not stay ensconced
in the land of dreams
I returned to labor simply
beside others
for everyone
So that everyone
may live here
I build my house
with transparent
odes
