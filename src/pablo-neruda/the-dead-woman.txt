If suddenly you do not exist
if suddenly you no longer live
I shall live on
I do not dare
I do not dare to write it
if you die
I shall live on
For where a man has no voice
there my voice
Where blacks are beaten
I cannot be dead
When my brothers go to prison
I shall go with them
When victory
not my victory
but the great victory comes
even though I am mute I must speak
I shall see it come even
though I am blind
No forgive me
If you no longer live
if you beloved my love
if you have died
all the leaves will fall in my breast
it will rain on my soul night and day
the snow will burn my heart
I shall walk with frost and fire and death and snow
my feet will want to walk to where you are sleeping but
I shall stay alive
because above all things
you wanted me indomitable
and my love because you know that I am not only a man
but all mankind
