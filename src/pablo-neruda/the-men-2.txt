I'm Ramón González Barbagelata from anywhere
from Cucuy from Paraná from Rio Turbio from Oruro
from Maracaibo from Parral from Ovalle from Loconmilla
I'm the poor devil from the poor Third World
I'm the third-class passenger installed good God
in the lavish whiteness of snow-covered mountains
concealed among orchids of subtle idiosyncrasy
I've arrived at this famous year 20000 and what do I get
