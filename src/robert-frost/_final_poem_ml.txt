He halted in the wind and what was that
Far in the maples pale but not a ghost
He stood there bringing March against his thought
And yet too ready to believe the most
Oh thats the Paradiseinbloom I said
And truly it was fair enough for flowers
had we but in us to assume in march
Such white luxuriance of May for ours
We stood a moment so in a strange world
Myself as one his own pretense deceives
And then I said the truth and we moved on
A young beech clinging to its last years leaves
The farmhouse lingers though averse to square
With the new city street it has to wear
A number in But what about the brook
That held the house as in an elbowcrook
I ask as one who knew the brook its strength
And impulse having dipped a finger length
And made it leap my knuckle having tossed
A flower to try its currents where they crossed
The meadow grass could be cemented down
From growing under pavements of a town
The apple trees be sent to hearthstone flame
Is water wood to serve a brook the same
How else dispose of an immortal force
No longer needed Staunch it at its source
With cinder loads dumped down The brook was thrown
Deep in a sewer dungeon under stone
In fetid darkness still to live and run
And all for nothing it had ever done
Except forget to go in fear perhaps
No one would know except for ancient maps
That such a brook ran water But I wonder
If from its being kept forever under
The thoughts may not have risen that so keep
This newbuilt city from both work and sleep
There sandy seems the golden sky
And golden seems the sandy plain
No habitation meets the eye
Unless in the horizon rim
Some halfway up the limestone wall
That spot of black is not a stain
Or shadow but a cavern hole
Where someone used to climb and crawl
To rest from his besetting fears
I see the callus on his soul
The disappearing last of him
And of his race starvation slim
Oh years ago ten thousand years
Microscopic
A speck that would have been beneath my sight
On any but a paper sheet so white
Set off across what I had written there
And I had idly poised my pen in air
To stop it with a period of ink
When something strange about it made me think
This was no dust speck by my breathing blown
But unmistakably a living mite
With inclinations it could call its own
It paused as with suspicion of my pen
And then came racing wildly on again
To where my manuscript was not yet dry
Then paused again and either drank or smelt
With loathing for again it turned to fly
Plainly with an intelligence I dealt
It seemed too tiny to have room for feet
Yet must have had a set of them complete
To express how much it didnt want to die
It ran with terror and with cunning crept
It faltered I could see it hesitate
Then in the middle of the open sheet
Cower down in desperation to accept
Whatever I accorded it of fate
I have none of the tendererthanthou
Collectivistic regimenting love
With which the modern world is being swept
But this poor microscopic item now
Since it was nothing I knew evil of
I let it lie there till I hope it slept
I have a mind myself and recognize
Mind when I meet with it in any guise
No one can know how glad I am to find
On any sheet the least display of mind
I had withdrawn in forest and my song
Was swallowed up in leaves that blew alway
And to the forest edge you came one day
This was my dream and looked and pondered long
But did not enter though the wish was strong
You shook your pensive head as who should say
‘I dare nottoo far in his footsteps stray
He must seek me would he undo the wrong
Not far but near I stood and saw it all
Behind low boughs the trees let down outside
And the sweet pang it cost me not to call
And tell you that I saw does still abide
But ’tis not true that thus I dwelt aloof
For the wood wakes and you are here for proof
Old Davis owned a solid mica mountain
In Dalton that would someday make his fortune
Thered been some Boston people out to see it
And experts said that deep down in the mountain
The mica sheets were big as plateglass windows
Hed like to take me there and show it to me
Ill tell you what you show me You remember
You said you knew the place where once on Kinsman
The early Mormons made a settlement
And built a stone baptismal font outdoors
But Smith or someone called them off the mountain
To go West to a worse fight with the desert
You said youd seen the stone baptismal font
Well take me there
Someday I will
Today
Huh that old bathtub what is that to see
Lets talk about it
Lets go see the place
To shut you up Ill tell you what Ill do
Ill find that fountain if it takes all summer
And both of our united strengths to do it
Youve lost it then
Not so but I can find it
No doubt its grown up some to woods around it
The mountain may have shifted since I saw it
In eightyfive
As long ago as that
If I remember rightly it had sprung
A leak and emptied then And forty years
Can do a good deal to bad masonry
You wont see any Mormon swimming in it
But you have said it and were off to find it
Old as I am Im going to let myself
Be dragged by you all over everywhere 
I thought you were a guide
I am a guide
And thats why I cant decently refuse you
We made a day of it out of the world
Ascending to descend to reascend
The old man seriously took his bearings
And spoke his doubts in every open place
We came out on a lookoff where we faced
A cliff and on the cliff a bottle painted
Or stained by vegetation from above
A likeness to surprise the thrilly tourist
Well if I havent brought you to the fountain
At least Ive brought you to the famous Bottle
I wont accept the substitute Its empty
Sos everything
I want my fountain
I guess youd find the fountain just as empty
And anyway this tells me where I am
Hadnt you long suspected where you were
You mean miles from that Mormon settlement
Look here you treat your guide with due respect
If you dont want to spend the night outdoors
I vow we must be near the place from where
The two converging slides the avalanches
On Marshall look like donkeys ears
We may as well see that and save the day
Dont donkeys ears suggest we shake our own
For Gods sake arent you fond of viewing nature
You dont like nature All you like is books
What signify a donkeys cars and bottle
However natural Give you your books
Well then right here is where I show you books
Come straight down off this mountain just as fast
As we can fall and keep abouncing on our feet
Its hell for knees unless done hellforleather
Be ready I thought for almost anything
We struck a road I didnt recognize
But welcomed for the chance to lave my shoes
In dust once more We followed this a mile
Perhaps to where it ended at a house
I didnt know was there It was the kind
To bring me to for broadboard paneling
I never saw so good a house deserted
Excuse me if I ask you in a window
That happens to be broken Davis said
The outside doors as yet have held against us
I want to introduce you to the people
Who used to live here They were Robinsons
You must have heard of Clara Robinson
The poetess who wrote the book of verses
And had it published It was all about
The posies on her inner windowsill
And the birds on her outer windowsill
And how she tended both or had them tended
She never tended anything herself
She was shut in for life She lived her whole
Life long in bed and wrote her things in bed
Ill show You how she had her sills extended
To entertain the birds and hold the flowers
Our business firsts up attic with her books
We trod uncomfortably on crunching glass
Through a house stripped of everything
Except it seemed the poetesss poems
Books I should say if books are what is needed
A whole edition in a packing case
That overflowing like a horn of plenty
Or like the poetesss heart of love
Had spilled them near the window toward the light
Where driven rain had wet and swollen them
Enough to stock a village library
Unfortunately all of one kind though
They bad been brought home from some publisher
And taken thus into the family
Boys and bad hunters had known what to do
With stone and lead to unprotected glass
Shatter it inward on the unswept floors
How had the tender verse escaped their outrage
By being invisible for what it was
Or else by some remoteness that defied them
To find out what to do to hurt a poem
Yet oh the tempting flatness of a book
To send it sailing out the attic window
Till it caught wind and opening out its covers
Tried to improve on sailing like a tile
By flying like a bird silent in flight
But all the burden of its body song
Only to tumble like a stricken bird
And lie in stones and bushes unretrieved
Books were not thrown irreverently about
They simply lay where someone now and then
Having tried one had dropped it at his feet
And left it lying where it fell rejected
Here were all those the poetesss life
Had been too short to sell or give away
Take one Old Davis bade me graciously
Why not take two or three
Take all you want
Goodlooking books like that He picked one fresh
In virgin wrapper from deep in the box
And stroked it with a hornyhanded kindness
He read in one and I read in another
Both either looking for or finding something
The attic wasps went missing by like bullets
I was soon satisfied for the time being
All the way home I kept remembering
The small book in my pocket It was there
The poetess had sighed I knew in heaven
At having eased her heart of one more copy
Legitimately My demand upon her
Though slight was a demand She felt the tug
In time she would be rid of all her books
A neighbor of mine in the village
Likes to tell how one spring
When she was a girl on the farm she did
A childlike thing
One day she asked her father
To give her a garden plot
To plant and tend and reap herself
And he said Why not
In casting about for a corner
He thought of an idle bit
Of walledoff ground where a shop had stood
And he said Just it
And he said That ought to make you
An ideal onegirl farm
And give you a chance to put some strength
On your slimjim arm
It was not enough of a garden
Her father said to plow
So she had to work it all by hand
But she dont mind now
She wheeled the dung in a wheelbarrow
Along a stretch of road
But she always ran away and left
Her notnice load
And hid from anyone passing
And then she begged the seed
She says she thinks she planted one
Of all things but weed
A hill each of potatoes
Radishes lettuce peas
Tomatoes beets beans pumpkins corn
And even fruit trees
And yes she has long mistrusted
That a ciderapple
In bearing there today is hers
Or at least may be
Her crop was a miscellany
When all was said and done
A little bit of everything
A great deal of none
Now when she sees in the village
How village things go
Just when it seems to come in right
She says I know
Its as when I was a farmer
Oh never by way of advice
And she never sins by telling the tale
To the same person twice
To think to know the country and now know
The hillside on the day the sun lets go
Ten million silver lizards out of snow
As often as Ive seen it done before
I cant pretend to tell the way its done
It looks as if some magic of the sun
Lifted the rug that bred them on the floor
And the light breaking on them made them run
But if I though to stop the wet stampede
And caught one silver lizard by the tail
And put my foot on one without avail
And threw myself wetelbowed and wetkneed
In front of twenty others wriggling speed
In the confusion of them all aglitter
And birds that joined in the excited fun
By doubling and redoubling song and twitter
I have no doubt Id end by holding none
It takes the moon for this The suns a wizard
By all I tell but sos the moon a witch
From the high west she makes a gentle cast
And suddenly without a jerk or twitch
She has her speel on every single lizard
I fancied when I looked at six oclock
The swarm still ran and scuttled just as fast
The moon was waiting for her chill effect
I looked at nine the swarm was turned to rock
In every lifelike posture of the swarm
Transfixed on mountain slopes almost erect
Across each other and side by side they lay
The spell that so could hold them as they were
Was wrought through trees without a breath of storm
To make a leaf if there had been one stir
It was the moons She held them until day
One lizard at the end of every ray
When I go up through the mowing field
The headless aftermath
Smoothlaid like thatch with the heavy dew
Half closes the garden path
And when I come to the garden ground
The whir of sober birds
Up from the tangle of withered weeds
Is sadder than any words
A tree beside the wall stands bare
But a leaf that lingered brown
Disturbed I doubt not by my thought
Comes softly rattling down
I end not far from my going forth
By picking the faded blue
Of the last remaining aster flower
To carry again to you
The linestorm clouds fly tattered and swift
The road is forlorn all day
Where a myriad snowy quartz stones lift
And the hoofprints vanish away
The roadside flowers too wet for the bee
Expend their bloom in vain
Come over the hills and far with me
And be my love in the rain
The birds have less to say for themselves
In the woodworld’s torn despair
Than now these numberless years the elves
Although they are no less there
All song of the woods is crushed like some
Wild easily shattered rose
Come be my love in the wet woods come
Where the boughs rain when it blows
There is the gale to urge behind
And bruit our singing down
And the shallow waters aflutter with wind
From which to gather your gown
What matter if we go clear to the west
And come not through dryshod
For wilding brooch shall wet your breast
The rainfresh goldenrod
Oh never this whelming east wind swells
But it seems like the sea’s return
To the ancient lands where it left the shells
Before the age of the fern
And it seems like the time when after doubt
Our love came back amain
Oh come forth into the storm and rout
And be my love in the rain
I have wished a bird would fly away
And not sing by my house all day
Have clapped my hands at him from the door
When it seemed as if I could bear no more
The fault must partly have been in me
The bird was not to blame for his key
And of course there must be something wrong
In wanting to silence any song
To Ridgely Torrence
On Last Looking into His Hesperides
I often see flowers from a passing car
That are gone before I can tell what they are
I want to get out of the train and go back
To see what they were beside the track
I name all the flowers I am sure they werent
Not fireweed loving where woods have burnt
Not bluebells gracing a tunnel mouth
Not lupine living on sand and drouth
Was something brushed across my mind
That no one on earth will ever find
Heaven gives it glimpses only to those
Not in position to look too close
Theres a patch of old snow in a corner
That I should have guessed
Was a blowaway paper the rain
Had brought to rest
It is speckled with grime as if
Small print overspread it
The news of a day Ive forgotten
If I ever read it
Dust always blowing about the town
Except when seafog laid it down
And I was one of the children told
Some of the blowing dust was gold
All the dust the wind blew high
Appeared like god in the sunset sky
But I was one of the children told
Some of the dust was really gold
Such was life in the Golden Gate
Gold dusted all we drank and ate
And I was one of the children told
We all must eat our peck of gold
Oh give us pleasure in the flowers today
And give us not to think so far away
As the uncertain harvest keep us here
All simply in the springing of the year
Oh give us pleasure in the orchard white
Like nothing else by day like ghosts by night
And make us happy in the happy bees
The swarm dilating round the perfect trees
And make us happy in the darting bird
That suddenly above the bees is heard
The meteor that thrusts in with needle bill
And off a blossom in mid air stands still
For this is love and nothing else is love
The which it is reserved for God above
To sanctify to what far ends He will
But which it only needs that we fulfil
A voice said Look me in the stars
And tell me truly men of earth
If all the soulandbody scars
Were not too much to pay for birth
I didnt make you know how glad I was
To have you come and camp here on our land
I promised myself to get down some day
And see the way you lived but I dont know
With a houseful of hungry men to feed
I guess youd find It seems to me
I cant express my feelings any more
Than I can raise my voice or want to lift
My hand oh I can lift it when I have to
Did ever you feel so I hope you never
Its got so I dont even know for sure
Whether I am glad sorry or anything
Theres nothing but a voicelike left inside
That seems to tell me how I ought to feel
And would feel if I wasnt all gone wrong
You take the lake I look and look at it
I see its a fair pretty sheet of water
I stand and make myself repeat out loud
The advantages it has so long and narrow
Like a deep piece of some old running river
Cut short off at both ends It lies five miles
Straight away through the mountain notch
From the sink window where I wash the plates
And all our storms come up toward the house
Drawing the slow waves whiter and whiter and whiter
It took my mind off doughnuts and soda biscuit
To step outdoors and take the water dazzle
A sunny morning or take the rising wind
About my face and body and through my wrapper
When a storm threatened from the Dragons Den
And a cold chill shivered across the lake
I see its a fair pretty sheet of water
Our Willoughby How did you hear of it
I expect though everyones heard of it
In a book about ferns Listen to that
You let things more like feathers regulate
Your going and coming And you like it here
I can see how you might But I dont know
It would be different if more people came
For then there would be business As it is
The cottages Len built sometimes we rent them
Sometimes we dont Weve a good piece of shore
That ought to be worth something and may yet
But I dont count on it as much as Len
He looks on the bright side of everything
Including me He thinks Ill be all right
With doctoring But its not medicine
Lowe is the only doctors dared to say so
Its rest I wantthere I have said it out
From cooking meals for hungry hired men
And washing dishes after themfrom doing
Things over and over that just wont stay done
By good rights I ought not to have so much
Put on me but there seems no other way
Len says one steady pull more ought to do it
He says the best way out is always through
And I agree to that or in so far
As that I can see no way out but through
Leastways for meand then theyll be convinced
Its not that Len dont want the best for me
It was his plan our moving over in
Beside the lake from where that day I showed you
We used to liveten miles from anywhere
We didnt change without some sacrifice
But Len went at it to make up the loss
His works a mans of course from sun to sun
But he works when he works as hard as I do
Though theres small profit in comparisons
Women and men will make them all the same
But work aint all Len undertakes too much
Hes into everything in town This year
Its highways and hes got too many men
Around him to look after that make waste
They take advantage of him shamefully
And proud too of themselves for doing so
We have four here to board great goodfornothings
Sprawling about the kitchen with their talk
While I fry their bacon Much they care
No more put out in what they do or say
Than if I wasnt in the room at all
Coming and going all the time they are
I dont learn what their names are let alone
Their characters or whether they are safe
To have inside the house with doors unlocked
Im not afraid of them though if theyre not
Afraid of me Theres two can play at that
I have my fancies it runs in the family
My fathers brother wasnt right They kept him
Locked up for years back there at the old farm
Ive been away onceyes Ive been away
The State Asylum I was prejudiced
I wouldnt have sent anyone of mine there
You know the old ideathe only asylum
Was the poorhouse and those who could afford
Rather than send their folks to such a place
Kept them at home and it does seem more human
But its not so the place is the asylum
There they have every means proper to do with
And you arent darkening other peoples lives
Worse than no good to them and they no good
To you in your condition you cant know
Affection or the want of it in that state
Ive heard too much of the oldfashioned way
My fathers brother he went mad quite young
Some thought he had been bitten by a dog
Because his violence took on the form
Of carrying his pillow in his teeth
But its more likely he was crossed in love
Or so the story goes It was some girl
Anyway all he talked about was love
They soon saw he would do someone a mischief
If he want kept strict watch of and it ended
In fathers building him a sort of cage
Or room within a room of hickory poles
Like stanchions in the barn from floor to ceiling
A narrow passage all the way around
Anything they put in for furniture
Hed tear to pieces even a bed to lie on
So they made the place comfortable with straw
Like a beasts stall to ease their consciences
Of course they had to feed him without dishes
They tried to keep him clothed but he paraded
With his clothes on his armall of his clothes
Cruelit sounds I spose they did the best
They knew And just when he was at the height
Father and mother married and mother came
A bride to help take care of such a creature
And accommodate her young life to his
That was what marrying father meant to her
She had to lie and hear love things made dreadful
By his shouts in the night Hed shout and shout
Until the strength was shouted out of him
And his voice died down slowly from exhaustion
Hed pull his bars apart like bow and bowstring
And let them go and make them twang until
His hands had worn them smooth as any oxbow
And then hed crow as if he thought that childs play
The only fun he had Ive heard them say though
They found a way to put a stop to it
He was before my timeI never saw him
But the pen stayed exactly as it was
There in the upper chamber in the ell
A sort of catchall full of attic clutter
I often think of the smooth hickory bars
It got so I would sayyou know half fooling
Its time I took my turn upstairs in jail
Just as you will till it becomes a habit
No wonder I was glad to get away
Mind you I waited till Len said the word
I didnt want the blame if things went wrong
I was glad though no end when we moved out
And I looked to be happy and I was
As I said for a whilebut I dont know
Somehow the change wore out like a prescription
And theres more to it than just windowviews
And living by a lake Im past such help
Unless Len took the notion which he wont
And I wont ask himits not sure enough
I spose Ive got to go the road Im going
Other folks have to and why shouldnt I
I almost think if I could do like you
Drop everything and live out on the ground
But it might be come night I shouldnt like it
Or a long rain I should soon get enough
And be glad of a good roof overhead
Ive lain awake thinking of you Ill warrant
More than you have yourself some of these nights
The wonder was the tents werent snatched away
From over you as you lay in your beds
I havent courage for a risk like that
Bless you of course youre keeping me from work
But the thing of it is I need to be kept
Theres work enough to dotheres always that
But behinds behind The worst that you can do
Is set me back a little more behind
I shant catch up in this world anyway
Id rather youd not go unless you must
He is that fallen lance that lies as hurled
That lies unlifted now come dew come rust
But still lies pointed as it plowed the dust
If we who sight along it round the world
See nothing worthy to have been its mark
It is because like men we look too near
Forgetting that as fitted to the sphere
Our missiles always make too short an arc
They fall they rip the grass they intersect
The curve of earth and striking break their own
They make us cringe for metalpoint on stone
But this we know the obstacle that checked
And tripped the body shot the spirit on
Further than target ever showed or shone
For Lincoln MacVeagh
Never tell me that not one star of all
That slip from heaven at night and softly fall
Has been picked up with stones to build a wall
Some laborer found one faded and stonecold
And saving that its weight suggested gold
And tugged it from his first too certain hold
He noticed nothing in it to remark
He was not used to handling stars thrown dark
And lifeless from an interrupted arc
He did not recognize in that smooth coal
The one thing palpable besides the soul
To penetrate the air in which we roll
He did not see how like a flying thing
It brooded ant eggs and bad one large wing
One not so large for flying in a ring
And a long Bird of Paradises tail
Though these when not in use to fly and trail
It drew back in its body like a snail
Nor know that be might move it from the spot
The harm was done from having been starshot
The very nature of the soil was hot
And burning to yield flowers instead of grain
Flowers fanned and not put out by all the rain
Poured on them by his prayers prayed in vain
He moved it roughly with an iron bar
He loaded an old stoneboat with the star
And not as you might think a flying car
Such as even poets would admit perforce
More practical than Pegasus the horse
If it could put a star back in its course
He dragged it through the plowed ground at a pace
But faintly reminiscent of the race
Of jostling rock in interstellar space
It went for building stone and I as though
Commanded in a dream forever go
To right the wrong that this should have been so
Yet ask where else it could have gone as well
I do not knowI cannot stop to tell
He might have left it lying where it fell
From following walls I never lift my eye
Except at night to places in the sky
Where showers of charted meteors let fly
Some may know what they seek in school and church
And why they seek it there for what I search
I must go measuring stone walls perch on perch
Sure that though not a star of death and birth
So not to be compared perhaps in worth
To such resorts of life as Mars and Earth
Though not I say a star of death and sin
It yet has poles and only needs a spin
To show its worldly nature and begin
To chafe and shuffle in my calloused palm
And run off in strange tangents with my arm
As fish do with the line in first alarm
Such as it is it promises the prize
Of the one world complete in any size
That I am like to compass fool or wise
When a friend calls to me from the road
And slows his horse to a meaning walk
I dont stand still and look around
On all the hills I havent hoed
And shout from where I am What is it
No not as there is a time to talk
I thrust my hoe in the mellow ground
Bladeend up and five feet tall
And plod I go up to the stone wall
For a friendly visit
A winter garden in an alder swamp
Where conies now come out to sun and romp
As near a paradise as it can be
And not melt snow or start a dormant tree
It lifts existence on a plane of snow
One level higher than the earth below
One level nearer heaven overhead
And last years berries shining scarlet red
It lifts a gaunt luxuriating beast
Where he can stretch and hold his highest feat
On some wild apple trees young tender bark
What well may prove the years high girdle mark
So near to paradise all pairing ends
Here loveless birds now flock as winter friends
Content with budinspecting They presume
To say which buds are leaf and which are bloom
A featherhammer gives a double knock
This Eden day is done at two oclock
An hour of winter day might seem too short
To make it worth lifes while to wake and sport
When the spent sun throws up its rays on cloud
And goes down burning into the gulf below
No voice in nature is heard to cry aloud
At what has happened Birds at least must know
It is the change to darkness in the sky
Murmuring something quiet in her breast
One bird begins to close a faded eye
Or overtaken too far from his nest
Hurrying low above the grove some waif
Swoops just in time to his remembered tree
At most he thinks or twitters softly Safe
Now let the night be dark for all of me
Let the night bee too dark for me to see
Into the future Let what will be be
I have been one acquainted with the night
I have walked out in rain and back in rain
I have outwalked the furthest city light
I have looked down the saddest city lane
I have passed by the watchman on his beat
And dropped my eyes unwilling to explain
I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet
When far away an interrupted cry
Came over houses from another street
But not to call me back or say goodbye
And further still at an unearthly height
One luminary clock against the sky
Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right
I have been one acquainted with the night
My long twopointed ladders sticking through a tree
Toward heaven still
And theres a barrel that I didnt fill
Beside it and there may be two or three
Apples I didnt pick upon some bough
But I am done with applepicking now
Essence of winter sleep is on the night
The scent of apples I am drowsing off
I cannot shake the shimmer from my sight
I got from looking through a pane of glass
I skimmed this morning from the watertrough
And held against the world of hoary grass
It melted and I let it fall and break
But I was well
Upon my way to sleep before it fell
And I could tell
What form my dreaming was about to take
Magnified apples appear and reappear
Stem end and blossom end
And every fleck of russet showing clear
My instep arch not only keeps the ache
It keeps the pressure of a ladderround
And I keep hearing from the cellarbin
That rumbling sound
Of load on load of apples coming in
For I have had too much
Of applepicking I am overtired
Of the great harvest I myself desired
There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch
Cherish in hand lift down and not let fall
For all
That struck the earth
No matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble
Went surely to the ciderapple heap
As of no worth
One can see what will trouble
This sleep of mine whatever sleep it is
Were he not gone
The woodchuck could say whether its like his
Long sleep as I describe its coming on
Or just some human sleep
I stay
But it isnt as if
There wasnt always Hudsons Bay
And the fur trade
A small skiff
And a paddle blade
I can just see my tent pegged
And me on the floor
Crosslegged
And a trapper looking in at the door
With furs to sell
His names Joe
Alias John
And between what he doesnt know
And wont tell
About where Henry Hudsons gone
I cant say hes much help
But we get on
The seal yelp
On an ice cake
Its not men by some mistake
No
Theres not a soul
For a windbreak
Between me and the North Pole
Except always JohnJoe
My French Indian Esquimaux
And hes off setting traps
In one himself perhaps
Give a headshake
Over so much bay
Thrown away
In snow and mist
That doesnt exist
I was going to say
For God man or beasts sake
Yet does perhaps for all three
Dont ask Joe
What it is to him
Its sometimes dim
What it is to me
Unless it be
Its the old captains dark fate
Who failed to find or force a strait
In its twothousandmile coast
And his crew left him where be failed
And nothing came of all be sailed
Its to say You and I
To such a ghost
You and I
Off here
With the dead race of the Great Auk
And Better defeat almost
If seen clear
Than lifes victories of doubt
That need endless talktalk
To make them out
ONCE on the kind of day called weather breeder
When the heat slowly hazes and the sun
By its own power seems to be undone
I was half boring through half climbing through
A swamp of cedar Choked with oil of cedar
And scurf of plants and weary and overheated
And sorry I ever left the road I knew
I paused and rested on a sort of hook
That had me by the coat as good as seated
And since there was no other way to look
Looked up toward heaven and there against the blue
Stood over me a resurrected tree
A tree that had been down and raised again
A barkless spectre He had halted too
As if for fear of treading upon me
I saw the strange position of his hands
Up at his shoulders dragging yellow strands
Of wire with something in it from men to men
You here I said Where arent you nowadays
And whats the news you carryif you know
And tell me where youre off forMontreal
Me Im not off for anywhere at all
Sometimes I wander out of beaten ways
Half looking for the orchid Calypso
All out of doors looked darkly in at him
Through the thin frost almost in separate stars
That gathers on the pane in empty rooms
What kept his eyes from giving back the gaze
Was the lamp tilted near them in his hand
What kept him from remembering what it was
That brought him to that creaking room was age
He stood with barrels round him at a loss
And having scared the cellar under him
In clomping there he scared it once again
In clomping off and scared the outer night
Which has its sounds familiar like the roar
Of trees and crack of branches common things
But nothing so like beating on a box
A light he was to no one but himself
Where now he sat concerned with he knew what
A quiet light and then not even that
He consigned to the moon such as she was
So latearising to the broken moon
As better than the sun in any case
For such a charge his snow upon the roof
His icicles along the wall to keep
And slept The log that shifted with a jolt
Once in the stove disturbed him and he shifted
And eased his heavy breathing but still slept
One aged man one man cant keep a house
A farm a countryside or if he can
Its thus he does it of a winter night
A house that lacks seemingly mistress and master
With doors that none but the wind ever closes
Its floor all littered with glass and with plaster
It stands in a garden of oldfashioned roses
I pass by that way in the gloaming with Mary
I wonder I say who the owner of those is
Oh no one you know she answers me airy
But one we must ask if we want any roses
So we must join hands in the dew coming coldly
There in the hush of the wood that reposes
And turn and go up to the open door boldly
And knock to the echoes as beggars for roses
Pray are you within there Mistress Whowereyou 
Tis Mary that speaks and our errand discloses
Pray are you within there Bestir you bestir you
Tis summer again theres two come for roses
A word with you that of the singer recalling
Old Herrick a saying that every maid knows is
A flower unplucked is but left to the falling
And nothing is gained by not gathering roses
We do not loosen our hands intertwining
Not caring so very much what she supposes
There when she comes on us mistily shining
And grants us by silence the boon of her roses
Inscription for a Garden Wall
Winds blow the open grassy places bleak
But where this old wall burns a sunny cheek
They eddy over it too toppling weak
To blow the earth or anything selfclear
Moisture and color and odor thicken here
The hours of daylight gather atmosphere
Where had I heard this wind before
Change like this to a deeper roar
What would it take my standing there for
Holding open a restive door
Looking down hill to a frothy shore
Summer was past and the day was past
Sombre clouds in the west were massed
Out on the porchs sagging floor
Leaves got up in a coil and hissed
Blindly struck at my knee and missed
Something sinister in the tone
Told me my secret must be known
Word I was in the house alone
Somehow must have gotten abroad
Word I was in my life alone
Word I had no one left but God
When I see birches bend to left and right
Across the lines of straighter darker trees
I like to think some boys been swinging them
But swinging doesnt bend them down to stay
Icestorms do that Often you must have seen them
Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning
After a rain They click upon themselves
As the breeze rises and turn manycoloured
As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel
Soon the suns warmth makes them shed crystal shells
Shattering and avalanching on the snowcrust
Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away
Youd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen
They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load
And they seem not to break though once they are bowed
So low for long they never right themselves
You may see their trunks arching in the woods
Years afterwards trailing their leaves on the ground
Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair
Before them over their heads to dry in the sun
But I was going to say when Truth broke in
With all her matteroffact about the icestorm
I should prefer to have some boy bend them
As he went out and in to fetch the cows
Some boy too far from town to learn baseball
Whose only play was what he found himself
Summer or winter and could play alone
One by one he subdued his fathers trees
By riding them down over and over again
Until he took the stiffness out of them
And not one but hung limp not one was left
For him to conquer He learned all there was
To learn about not launching out too soon
And so not carrying the tree away
Clear to the ground He always kept his poise
To the top branches climbing carefully
With the same pains you use to fill a cup
Up to the brim and even above the brim
Then he flung outward feet first with a swish
Kicking his way down through the air to the ground
So was I once myself a swinger of birches
And so I dream of going back to be
Its when Im weary of considerations
And life is too much like a pathless wood
Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs
Broken across it and one eye is weeping
From a twigs having lashed across it open
Id like to get away from earth awhile
And then come back to it and begin over
May no fate willfully misunderstand me
And half grant what I wish and snatch me away
Not to return Earths the right place for love
I dont know where its likely to go better
Id like to go by climbing a birch tree
And climb black branches up a snowwhite trunk
Toward heaven till the tree could bear no more
But dipped its top and set me down again
That would be good both going and coming back
One could do worse than be a swinger of birches
It is bluebutterfly day here in spring
And with these skyflakes down in flurry on flurry
There is more unmixed color on the wing
Than flowers will show for days unless they hurry
But these are flowers that fly and all but sing
And now from having ridden out desire
They lie closed over in the wind and cling
Where wheels have freshly sliced the April mire
You ought to have seen what I saw on my way To the village through Mortensons pasture today Blueberries as big as the end of your thumb Real skyblue and heavy and ready to drum In the cavernous pail of the first one to come And all ripe together not some of them green And some of them ripe You ought to have seen  I dont know what part of the pasture you mean You know where they cut off the woodslet me see It was two years agoor no can it be No longer than that and the following fall The fire ran and burned it all up but the wall Why there hasnt been time for the bushes to grow Thats always the way with the blueberries though There may not have been the ghost of a sign Of them anywhere under the shade of the pine But get the pine out of the way you may burn The pasture all over until not a fern Or grassblade is left not to mention a stick And presto theyre up all around you as thick And hard to explain as a conjurors trick It must be on charcoal they fatten their fruit I taste in them sometimes the flavour of soot And after all really theyre ebony skinned The blues but a mist from the breath of the wind A tarnish that goes at a touch of the hand And less than the tan with which pickers are tanned Does Mortenson know what he has do you think  He may and not care and so leave the chewink To gather them for himyou know what he is He wont make the fact that theyre rightfully his An excuse for keeping us other folk out I wonder you didnt see Loren about The best of it was that I did Do you know I was just getting through what the field had to show And over the wall and into the road When who should come by with a democratload Of all the young chattering Lorens alive But Loren the fatherly out for a drive He saw you then What did he do Did he frown  He just kept nodding his head up and down You know how politely he always goes by But he thought a big thoughtI could tell by his eye Which being expressed might be this in effect I have left those there berries I shrewdly suspect To ripen too long I am greatly to blame Hes a thriftier person than some I could name He seems to be thrifty and hasnt he need With the mouths of all those young Lorens to feed He has brought them all up on wild berries they say Like birds They store a great many away They eat them the year round and those they dont eat They sell in the store and buy shoes for their feet Who cares what they say Its a nice way to live Just taking what Nature is willing to give Not forcing her hand with harrow and plow I wish you had seen his perpetual bow And the air of the youngsters Not one of them turned And they looked so solemnabsurdly concerned I wish I knew half what the flock of them know Of where all the berries and other things grow Cranberries in bogs and raspberries on top Of the boulderstrewn mountain and when they will crop I met them one day and each had a flower Stuck into his berries as fresh as a shower Some strange kindthey told me it hadnt a name Ive told you how once not long after we came I almost provoked poor Loren to mirth By going to him of all people on earth To ask if he knew any fruit to be had For the picking The rascal he said hed be glad To tell if he knew But the year had been bad There had been some berriesbut those were all gone He didnt say where they had been He went on Im sureIm sureas polite as could be He spoke to his wife in the door Let me see Mame we dont know any good berrying place  It was all he could do to keep a straight face If he thinks all the fruit that grows wild is for him Hell find hes mistaken See here for a whim Well pick in the Mortensons pasture this year Well go in the morning that is if its clear And the sun shines out warm the vines must be wet Its so long since I picked I almost forget How we used to pick berries we took one look round Then sank out of sight like trolls underground And saw nothing more of each other or heard Unless when you said I was keeping a bird Away from its nest and I said it was you Well one of us is For complaining it flew Around and around us And then for a while We picked till I feared you had wandered a mile And I thought I had lost you I lifted a shout Too loud for the distance you were it turned out For when you made answer your voice was as low As talkingyou stood up beside me you know We shant have the place to ourselves to enjoy Not likely when all the young Lorens deploy Theyll be there tomorrow or even tonight They wont be too friendlythey may be polite To people they look on as having no right To pick where theyre picking But we wont complain You ought to have seen how it looked in the rain The fruit mixed with water in layers of leaves Like two kinds of jewels a vision for thieves
Love has earth to which she clings
With hills and circling arms about
Wall within wall to shut fear out
But Thought has need of no such things
For Thought has a pair of dauntless wings
On snow and sand and turn I see
Where Love has left a printed trace
With straining in the worlds embrace
And such is Love and glad to be
But Thought has shaken his ankles free
Thought cleaves the interstellar gloom
And sits in Sirius disc all night
Till day makes him retrace his flight
With smell of burning on every plume
Back past the sun to an earthly room
His gains in heaven are what they are
Yet some say Love by being thrall
And simply staying possesses all
In several beauty that Thought fares far
To find fused in another star
Brown lived at such a lofty farm
That everyone for miles could see
His lantern when he did his chores
In winter after halfpast three
And many must have seen him make
His wild descent from there one night
Cross lots cross walls cross everything
Describing rings of lantern light
Between the house and barn the gale
Got him by something he had on
And blew him out on the icy crust
That cased the world and he was gone
Walls were all buried trees were few
He saw no stay unless he stove
A hole in somewhere with his heel
But though repeatedly he strove
And stamped and said things to himself
And sometimes something seemed to yield
He gained no foothold but pursued
His journey down from field to field
Sometimes he came with arms outspread
Like wings revolving in the scene
Upon his longer axis and
With no small dignity of mien
Faster or slower as he chanced
Sitting or standing as he chose
According as he feared to risk
His neck or thought to spare his clothes
He never let the lantern drop
And some exclaimed who saw afar
The figures he described with it
I wonder what those signals are
Brown makes at such an hour of night
Hes celebrating something strange
I wonder if hes sold his farm
Or been made Master of the Grange
He reeled he lurched he bobbed he checked
He fell and made the lantern rattle
But saved the light from going out
So halfway down he fought the battle
Incredulous of his own bad luck
And then becoming reconciled
To everything he gave it up
And came down like a coasting child
WellIbe that was all he said
As standing in the river road
He looked back up the slippery slope
Two miles it was to his abode
Sometimes as an authority
On motorcars Im asked if I
Should say our stock was petered out
And this is my sincere reply
Yankees are what they always were
Dont think Brown ever gave up hope
Of getting home again because
He couldnt climb that slippery slope
Or even thought of standing there
Until the January thaw
Should take the polish off the crust
He bowed with grace to natural law
And then went round it on his feet
After the manner of our stock
Not much concerned for those to whom
At that particular time oclock
It must have looked as if the course
He steered was really straight away
From that which he was headed for
Not much concerned for them I say
No more so than became a man
And politician at odd seasons
Ive kept Brown standing in the cold
While I invested him with reasons
But now he snapped his eyes three times
Then shook his lantern saying Iles
Bout out and took the long way home
By road a matter of several miles
But outer Space
At least this far
For all the fuss
Of the populace
Stays more popular
Than populous
The great Overdog
That heavenly beast
With a star in one eye
Gives a leap in the east
He dances upright
All the way to the west
And never once drops
On his forefeet to rest
Im a poor underdog
But tonight I will bark
With the great Overdog
That romps through the dark
Age saw two quiet children
Go loving by at twilight
He knew not whether homeward
Or outward from the village
Or chimes were ringing churchward
He waited they were strangers
Till they were out of hearing
To bid them both be happy
Be happy happy happy
And seize the day of pleasure
The agelong theme is Ages
Twas Age imposed on poems
Their gatherroses burden
To warn against the danger
That overtaken lovers
From being overflooded
With happiness should have it
And yet not know they have it
But bid life seize the present
It lives less in the present
Than in the future always
And less in both together
Than in the past The present
Is too much for the senses
Too crowding too confusing
Too present to imagine
The city had withdrawn into itself
And left at last the country to the country
When between whirls of snow not come to lie
And whirls of foliage not yet laid there drove
A stranger to our yard who looked the city
Yet did in country fashion in that there
He sat and waited till he drew us out
Abuttoning coats to ask him who he was
He proved to be the city come again
To look for something it had left behind
And could not do without and keep its Christmas
He asked if I would sell my Christmas trees
My woodsthe young fir balsams like a place
Where houses all are churches and have spires
I hadn’t thought of them as Christmas Trees
I doubt if I was tempted for a moment
To sell them off their feet to go in cars
And leave the slope behind the house all bare
Where the sun shines now no warmer than the moon
I’d hate to have them know it if I was
Yet more I’d hate to hold my trees except
As others hold theirs or refuse for them
Beyond the time of profitable growth
The trial by market everything must come to
I dallied so much with the thought of selling
Then whether from mistaken courtesy
And fear of seeming short of speech or whether
From hope of hearing good of what was mine
I said “There aren’t enough to be worth while”
“I could soon tell how many they would cut
You let me look them over”
“You could look
But don’t expect I’m going to let you have them”
Pasture they spring in some in clumps too close
That lop each other of boughs but not a few
Quite solitary and having equal boughs
All round and round The latter he nodded “Yes” to
Or paused to say beneath some lovelier one
With a buyer’s moderation “That would do”
I thought so too but wasn’t there to say so
We climbed the pasture on the south crossed over
And came down on the north
He said “A thousand”
“A thousand Christmas trees at what apiece ”
He felt some need of softening that to me
“A thousand trees would come to thirty dollars”
Then I was certain I had never meant
To let him have them Never show surprise
But thirty dollars seemed so small beside
The extent of pasture I should strip three cents
For that was all they figured out apiece
Three cents so small beside the dollar friends
I should be writing to within the hour
Would pay in cities for good trees like those
Regular vestrytrees whole Sunday Schools
Could hang enough on to pick off enough
A thousand Christmas trees I didn’t know I had
Worth three cents more to give away than sell
As may be shown by a simple calculation
Too bad I couldn’t lay one in a letter
I can’t help wishing I could send you one
In wishing you herewith a Merry Christmas
As I came to the edge of the woods
Thrush music hark
Now if it was dusk outside
Inside it was dark
Too dark in the woods for a bird
By sleight of wing
To better its perch for the night
Though it still could sing
The last of the light of the sun
That had died in the west
Still lived for one song more
In a thrushs breast
Far in the pillared dark
Thrush music went
Almost like a call to come in
To the dark and lament
But no I was out for stars
I would not come in
I meant not even if asked
And I hadnt been
An ant on the tablecloth
Ran into a dormant moth
Of many times his size
He showed not the least surprise
His business wasnt with such
He gave it scarcely a touch
And was off on his duty run
Yet if he encountered one
Of the hives enquiry squad
Whose work is to find out God
And the nature of time and space
He would put him onto the case
Ants are a curious race
One crossing with hurried tread
The body of one of their dead
Isnt given a moments arrest
Seems not even impressed
But he no doubt reports to any
With whom he crosses antennae
And they no doubt report
To the higherup at court
Then word goes forth in Formic
Deaths come to Jerry McCormic
Our selfless forager Jerry
Will the special Janizary
Whose office it is to bury
The dead of the commissary
Go bring him home to his people
Lay him in state on a sepal
Wrap him for shroud in a petal
Embalm him with ichor of nettle
This is the word of your Queen
And presently on the scene
Appears a solemn mortician
And taking formal position
With feelers calmly atwiddle
Seizes the dead by the middle
And heaving him high in air
Carries him out of there
No one stands round to stare
It is nobody elses affair
It couldnt be called ungentle
But how thoroughly departmental
Snow falling and night falling fast oh fast
In a field I looked into going past
And the ground almost covered smooth in snow
But a few weeds and stubble showing last
The woods around it have it it is theirs
All animals are smothered in their lairs
I am too absentspirited to count
The loneliness includes me unawares
And lonely as it is that loneliness
Will be more lonely ere it will be less
A blanker whiteness of benighted snow
WIth no expression nothing to express
They cannot scare me with their empty spaces
Between stars on stars where no human race is
I have it in me so much nearer home
To scare myself with my own desert places
I found a dimpled spider fat and white
On a white healall holding up a moth
Like a white piece of rigid satin cloth
Assorted characters of death and blight
Mixed ready to begin the morning right
Like the ingredients of a witches broth
A snowdrop spider a flower like a froth
And dead wings carried like a paper kite
What had that flower to do with being white
The wayside blue and innocent healall
What brought the kindred spider to that height
Then steered the white moth thither in the night
What but design of darkness to appall
If design govern in a thing so small
The heart can think of no devotion
Greater than being shore to ocean
Holding the curve of one position
Counting an endless repetition
Back out of all this now too much for us
Back in a time made simple by the loss
Of detail burned dissolved and broken off
Like graveyard marble sculpture in the weather
There is a house that is no more a house
Upon a farm that is no more a farm
And in a town that is no more a town
The road there if youll let a guide direct you
Who only has at heart your getting lost
May seem as if it should have been a quarry
Great monolithic knees the former town
Long since gave up pretense of keeping covered
And theres a story in a book about it
Besides the wear of iron wagon wheels
The ledges show lines ruled southeastnorthwest
The chisel work of an enormous Glacier
That braced his feet against the Arctic Pole
You must not mind a certain coolness from him
Still said to haunt this side of Panther Mountain
Nor need you mind the serial ordeal
Of being watched from forty cellar holes
As if by eye pairs out of forty firkins
As for the woods excitement over you
That sends light rustle rushes to their leaves
Charge that to upstart inexperience
Where were they all not twenty years ago
They think too much of having shaded out
A few old peckerfretted apple trees
Make yourself up a cheering song of how
Someones road home from work this once was
Who may be just ahead of you on foot
Or creaking with a buggy load of grain
The height of the adventure is the height
Of country where two village cultures faded
Into each other Both of them are lost
And if youre lost enough to find yourself
By now pull in your ladder road behind you
And put a sign up CLOSED to all but me
Then make yourself at home The only field
Now lefts no bigger than a harness gall
First theres the childrens house of makebelieve
Some shattered dishes underneath a pine
The playthings in the playhouse of the children
Weep for what little things could make them glad
Then for the house that is no more a house
But only a belilaced cellar hole
Now slowly closing like a dent in dough
This was no playhouse but a house in earnest
Your destination and your destinys
A brook that was the water of the house
Cold as a spring as yet so near its source
Too lofty and original to rage
We know the valley streams that when aroused
Will leave their tatters hung on barb and thorn
I have kept hidden in the instep arch
Of an old cedar at the waterside
A broken drinking goblet like the Grail
Under a spell so the wrong ones cant find it
So cant get saved as Saint Mark says they mustnt
I stole the goblet from the childrens playhouse
Here are your waters and your watering place
Drink and be whole again beyond confusion
If as they say some dust thrown in my eyes
Will keep my talk from getting overwise
Im not the one for putting off the proof
Let it be overwhelming off a roof
And round a corner blizzard snow for dust
And blind me to a standstill if it must
The way a crow
Shook down on me
The dust of snow
From a hemlock tree
Has given my heart
A change of mood
And saved some part
Of a day I had rued
From where I lingered in a lull in March
outside the sugarhouse one night for choice
I called the fireman with a careful voice
And bade him leave the pan and stoke the arch
O fireman give the fire another stoke
And send more sparks up chimney with the smoke
I thought a few might tangle as they did
Among bare maple boughs and in the rare
Hill atmosphere not cease to glow
And so be added to the moon up there
The moon though slight was moon enough to show
On every tree a bucket with a lid
And on black ground a bearskin rug of snow
The sparks made no attempt to be the moon
They were content to figure in the trees
As Leo Orion and the Pleiades
And that was what the boughs were full of soon
Some say the world will end in fire
Some say in ice
From what Ive tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire
But if it had to perish twice
I think I know enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice
Is also great
And would suffice
Here come real stars to fill the upper skies
And here on earth come emulating flies
That though they never equal stars in size
And they were never really stars at heart
Achieve at times a very starlike start
Only of course they cant sustain the part
I left you in the morning
And in the morning glow
You walked a way beside me
To make me sad to go
Do you know me in the gloaming
Gaunt and dusty gray with roaming
Are you dumb because you know me not
Or dumb because you know
All for me And not a question
For the faded flowers gay
That could take me from beside you
For the ages of a day
They are yours and be the measure
Of their worth for you to treasure
The measure of the little while
That Ive been long away
Others taught me with having knelt at wellcurbs
Always wrong to the light so never seeing
Deeper down in the well than where the water
Gives me back in a shining surface picture
Me myself in the summer heaven godlike
Looking out of a wreath of fern and cloud puffs
Once when trying with chin against a wellcurb
I discerned as I thought beyond the picture
Through the picture a something white uncertain
Something more of the depthsand then I lost it
Water came to rebuke the too clear water
One drop fell from a fern and lo a ripple
Shook whatever it was lay there at bottom
Blurred it blotted it out What was that whiteness
Truth A pebble of quartz For once then something
Why make so much of fragmentary blue
In here and there a bird or butterfly
Or flower or wearingstone or open eye
When heaven presents in sheets the solid hue
Since earth is earth perhaps not heaven as yet
Though some savants make earth include the sky
And blue so far above us comes so high
It only gives our wish for blue a whet
Spades take up leaves
No better than spoons
And bags full of leaves
Are light as balloons
I make a great noise
Of rustling all day
Like rabbit and deer
Running away
But the mountains I raise
Elude my embrace
Flowing over my arms
And into my face
I may load and unload
Again and again
Till I fill the whole shed
And what have I then
Next to nothing for weight
And since they grew duller
From contact with earth
Next to nothing for color
Next to nothing for use
But a crop is a crop
And whos to say where
The harvest shall stop
I dwell in a lonely house I know
That vanished many a summer ago
And left no trace but the cellar walls
And a cellar in which the daylight falls
And the purplestemmed wild raspberries grow
Oer ruined fences the grapevines shield
The woods come back to the mowing field
The orchard tree has grown one copse
Of new wood and old where the woodpecker chops
The footpath down to the well is healed
I dwell with a strangely aching heart
In that vanished abode there far apart
On that disused and forgotten road
That has no dustbath now for the toad
Night comes the black bats tumble and dart
The whippoorwill is coming to shout
And hush and cluck and flutter about
I hear him begin far enough away
Full many a time to say his say
Before he arrives to say it out
It is under the small dim summer star
I know not who these mute folk are
Who share the unlit place with me
Those stones out under the lowlimbed tree
Doubtless bear names that the mosses mar
They are tireless folk but slow and sad
Though two closekeeping are lass and lad
With none among them that ever sings
And yet in view of how many things
As sweet companions as might be had
God made a beatous garden
With lovely flowers strown
But one straight narrow pathway
That was not overgrown
And to this beauteous garden
He brought mankind to live
And said To you my children
These lovely flowers I give
Prune ye my vines and fig trees
With care my flowerets tend
But keep the pathway open
Your home is at the end
Then came another master
Who did not love mankind
And planted on the pathway
Gold flowers for them to find
And mankind saw the bright flowers
That glittring in the sun
Quite hid the thorns of avrice
That poison blood and bone
And far off many wandered
And when lifes night came on
They still were seeking gold flowers
Lost helpless and alone
O cease to heed the glamour
That blinds your foolish eyes
Look upward to the glitter
Of stars in Gods clear skies
Their ways are pure and harmless
And will not lead astray
Bid aid your erring footsteps
To keep the narrow way
And when the sun shines brightly
Tend flowers that God has given
And keep the pathway open
That leads you on to heaven
The well was dry beside the door
And so we went with pail and can
Across the fields behind the house
To seek the brook if still it ran
Not loth to have excuse to go
Because the autumn eve was fair
Though chill because the fields were ours
And by the brook our woods were there
We ran as if to meet the moon
That slowly dawned behind the trees
The barren boughs without the leaves
Without the birds without the breeze
But once within the wood we paused
Like gnomes that hid us from the moon
Ready to run to hiding new
With laughter when she found us soon
Each laid on other a staying hand
To listen ere we dared to look
And in the hush we joined to make
We heard we knew we heard the brook
A note as from a single place
A slender tinkling fall that made
Now drops that floated on the pool
Like pearls and now a silver blade
This saying goodbye on the edge of the dark
And cold to an orchard so young in the bark
Reminds me of all that can happen to harm
An orchard away at the end of the farm
All winter cut off by a hill from the house
I dont want it girdled by rabbit and mouse
I dont want it dreamily nibbled for browse
By deer and I dont want it budded by grouse
If certain it wouldnt be idle to call
Id summon grouse rabbit and deer to the wall
And warn them away with a stick for a gun
I dont want it stirred by the heat of the sun
We made it secure against being I hope
By setting it out on a northerly slope
No orchards the worse for the wintriest storm
But one thing about it it mustnt get warm
How often already youve had to be told
Keep cold young orchard Goodbye and keep cold
Dread fifty above more than fifty below
I have to be gone for a season or so
My business awhile is with different trees
Less carefully nourished less fruitful than these
And such as is done to their wood with an axe
Maples and birches and tamaracks
I wish I could promise to lie in the night
And think of an orchards arboreal plight
When slowly and nobody comes with a light
Its heart sinks lower under the sod
But something has to be left to God
I had for my winter evening walk
No one at all with whom to talk
But I had the cottages in a row
Up to their shining eyes in snow
And I thought I had the folk within
I had the sound of a violin
I had a glimpse through curtain laces
Of youthful forms and youthful faces
I had such company outward bound
I went till there were no cottages found
I turned and repented but coming back
I saw no window but that was black
Over the snow my creaking feet
Disturbed the slumbering village street
Like profanation by your leave
At ten oclock of a winter eve
Was there even a cause too lost
Ever a cause that was lost too long
Or that showed with the lapse of time to vain
For the generous tears of youth and song
He saw her from the bottom of the stairs
Before she saw him She was starting down
Looking back over her shoulder at some fear
She took a doubtful step and then undid it
To raise herself and look again He spoke
Advancing toward her What is it you see
From up there always for I want to know
She turned and sank upon her skirts at that
And her face changed from terrified to dull
He said to gain time What is it you see
Mounting until she cowered under him
I will find out now you must tell me dear
She in her place refused him any help
With the least stiffening of her neck and silence
She let him look sure that he wouldnt see
Blind creature and a while he didnt see
But at last he murmured Oh and again Oh
What is it what she said
Just that I see
You dont she challenged Tell me what it is
The wonder is I didnt see at once
I never noticed it from here before
I must be wonted to it thats the reason
The little graveyard where my people are
So small the window frames the whole of it
Not so much larger than a bedroom is it
There are three stones of slate and one of marble
Broadshouldered little slabs there in the sunlight
On the sidehill We havent to mind those
But I understand it is not the stones
But the childs mound 
Dont dont dont
dont she cried
She withdrew shrinking from beneath his arm
That rested on the banister and slid downstairs
And turned on him with such a daunting look
He said twice over before he knew himself
Cant a man speak of his own child hes lost
Not you Oh wheres my hat Oh I dont need it
I must get out of here I must get air
I dont know rightly whether any man can
Amy Dont go to someone else this time
Listen to me I wont come down the stairs
He sat and fixed his chin between his fists
Theres something I should like to ask you dear
You dont know how to ask it
Help me then
Her fingers moved the latch for all reply
My words are nearly always an offense
I dont know how to speak of anything
So as to please you But I might be taught
I should suppose I cant say I see how
A man must partly give up being a man
With womenfolk We could have some arrangement
By which Id bind myself to keep hands off
Anything special youre amind to name
Though I dont like such things twixt those that love
Two that dont love cant live together without them
But two that do cant live together with them
She moved the latch a little Dont dont go
Dont carry it to someone else this time
Tell me about it if its something human
Let me into your grief Im not so much
Unlike other folks as your standing there
Apart would make me out Give me my chance
I do think though you overdo it a little
What was it brought you up to think it the thing
To take your motherloss of a first child
So inconsolably in the face of love
Youd think his memory might be satisfied 
There you go sneering now
Im not Im not
You make me angry Ill come down to you
God what a woman And its come to this
A man cant speak of his own child thats dead
You cant because you dont know how to speak
If you had any feelings you that dug
With your own hand how could you his little grave
I saw you from that very window there
Making the gravel leap and leap in air
Leap up like that like that and land so lightly
And roll back down the mound beside the hole
I thought Who is that man I didnt know you
And I crept down the stairs and up the stairs
To look again and still your spade kept lifting
Then you came in I heard your rumbling voice
Out in the kitchen and I dont know why
But I went near to see with my own eyes
You could sit there with the stains on your shoes
Of the fresh earth from your own babys grave
And talk about your everyday concerns
You had stood the spade up against the wall
Outside there in the entry for I saw it
I shall laugh the worst laugh I ever laughed
Im cursed God if I dont believe Im cursed
I can repeat the very words you were saying
Three foggy mornings and one rainy day
Will rot the best birch fence a man can build
Think of it talk like that at such a time
What had how long it takes a birch to rot
To do with what was in the darkened parlour
You couldnt care The nearest friends can go
With anyone to death comes so far short
They might as well not try to go at all
No from the time when one is sick to death
One is alone and he dies more alone
Friends make pretense of following to the grave
But before one is in it their minds are turned
And making the best of their way back to life
And living people and things they understand
But the worlds evil I wont have grief so
If I can change it Oh I wont I wont
There you have said it all and you feel better
You wont go now Youre crying Close the door
The hearts gone out of it why keep it up
Amyl Theres someone coming down the road
You oh you think the talk is all I must go
Somewhere out of this house How can I make you 
If you do She was opening the door wider
Where do you mean to go First tell me that
Ill follow and bring you back by force I will 
By June our brooks run out of song and speed
Sought for much after that it will be found
Either to have gone groping underground
And taken with it all the Hyla breed
That shouted in the mist a month ago
Like ghost of sleighbells in a ghost of snow
Or flourished and come up in jewelweed
Weak foliage that is blown upon and bent
Even against the way its waters went
Its bed is left a faded paper sheet
Of dead leaves stuck together by the heat
A brook to none but who remember long
This as it will be seen is other far
Than with brooks taken otherwhere in song
We love the things we love for what they are
It was long I lay
Awake that night
Wishing that night
Would name the hour
And tell me whether
To call it day
Though not yet light
And give up sleep
The snow fell deep
With the hiss of spray
Two winds would meet
One down one street
One down another
And fight in a smother
Of dust and feather
I could not say
But feared the cold
Had checked the pace
Of the tower clock
By tying together
Its hands of gold
Before its face
Then cane one knock
A note unruffled
Of earthly weather
Though strange and muffled
The tower said One
And then a steeple
They spoke to themselves
And such few people
As winds might rouse
From sleeping warm
But not unhouse
They left the storm
That struck en masse
My window glass
Like a beaded fur
In that grave One
They spoke of the sun
And moon and stars
Saturn and Mars
And Jupiter
Still more unfettered
They left the named
And spoke of the lettered
The sigmas and taus
Of constellations
They filled their throats
With the furthest bodies
To which man sends his
Speculation
Beyond which God is
The cosmic motes
Of yawning lenses
Their solemn peals
Were not their own
They spoke for the clock
With whose vast wheels
Theirs interlock
In that grave word
Uttered alone
The utmost star
Trembled and stirred
Though set so far
Its whirling frenzies
Appear like standing
in one self station
It has not ranged
And save for the wonder
Of once expanding
To be a nova
It has not changed
To the eye of man
On planets over
Around and under
It in creation
Since man began
To drag down man
And nation nation
No ship of all that under sail or steam
Have gathered people to us more and more
But Pilgrimmanned the Mayflower in a dream
Has been her anxious convoy in to shore
The living come with grassy tread
To read the gravestones on the hill
The graveyard draws the living still
But never anymore the dead
The verses in it say and say
The ones who living come today
To read the stones and go away
Tomorrow dead will come to stay
So sure of death the marbles rhyme
Yet cant help marking all the time
How no one dead will seem to come
What is it men are shrinking from
It would be easy to be clever
And tell the stones Men hate to die
And have stopped dying now forever
I think they would believe the lie
The sentencing goes blithely on its way
And takes the playfully objected rhyme
As surely as it takes the stroke and time
In having its undeviable say
When I was young we dwelt in a vale
By a misty fen that rang all night
And thus it was the maidens pale
I knew so well whose garments trail
Across the reeds to a window light
The fen had every kind of bloom
And for every kind there was a face
And a voice that has sounded in my room
Across the sill from the outer gloom
Each came singly unto her place
But all came every night with the mist
And often they brought so much to say
Of things of moment to which they wist
One so lonely was fain to list
That the stars were almost faded away
Before the last went heavy with dew
Back to the place from which she came
Where the bird was before it flew
Where the flower was before it grew
Where bird and flower were one and the same
And thus it is I know so well
Why the flower has odor the bird has song
You have only to ask me and I can tell
No not vainly there did I dwell
Nor vainly listen all the night long
Thus of old the Douglas did
He left his land as he was bid
With the royal heart of Robert the Bruce
In a golden case with a golden lid
To carry the same to the Holy Land
By which we see and understand
That that was the place to carry a heart
At loyalty and loves command
And that was the case to carry it in
The Douglas had not far to win
Before he came to the land of Spain
Where long a holy war had been
Against the toovictorious Moor
And there his courage could not endure
Not to strike a blow for God
Before he made his errand sure
And ever it was intended so
That a man for God should strike a blow
No matter the heart he has in charge
For the Holy Land where hearts should go
But when in battle the foe were met
The Douglas found him sore beset
With only strength of the fighting arm
For one more battle passage yet
And that as vain to save the day
As bring his body safe away
Only a signal deed to do
And a last sounding word to say
The heart he wore in a golden chain
He swung and flung forth into the plain
And followed it crying Heart or death
And fighting over it perished fain
So may another do of right
Give a heart to the hopeless fight
The more of right the more he loves
So may another redouble might
For a few swift gleams of the angry brand
Scorning greatly not to demand
In equal sacrifice with his
The heart he bore to the Holy Land
The same leaves over and over again
They fall from giving shade above
To make one texture of faded brown
And fit the earth like a leather glove
Before the leaves can mount again
To fill the trees with another shade
They must go down past things coming up
They must go down into the dark decayed
They must be pierced by flowers and put
Beneath the feet of dancing flowers
However it is in some other world
I know that this is way in ours
They leave us so to the way we took As two in whom them were proved mistaken That we sit sometimes in the wayside nook With michievous vagrant seraphic look And try if we cannot feel forsaken
SHE stood against the kitchen sink and looked
Over the sink out through a dusty window
At weeds the water from the sink made tall
She wore her cape her hat was in her hand
Behind her was confusion in the room
Of chairs turned upside down to sit like people
In other chairs and something come to look
For every room a house hasparlor bedroom
And diningroomthrown pellmell in the kitchen
And now and then a smudged infernal face
Looked in a door behind her and addressed
Her back She always answered without turning
Where will I put this walnut bureau lady
Put it on top of something thats on top
Of something else she laughed Oh put it where
You can tonight and go Its almost dark
You must be getting started back to town
Another blackened face thrust in and looked
And smiled and when she did not turn spoke gently
What are you seeing out the window lady
Never was I beladied so before
Would evidence of having been called lady
More than so many times make me a lady
In common law I wonder
But I ask
What are you seeing out the window lady
What Ill be seeing more of in the years
To come as here I stand and go the round
Of many plates with towels many times
And what is that You only put me off
Rank weeds that love the water from the dishpan
More than some women like the dishpan Joe
A little stretch of mowingfield for you
Not much of that until I come to woods
That end all And its scarce enough to call
A view
And yet you think you like it dear
Thats what youre so concerned to know You hope
I like it Bang goes something big away
Off there upstairs The very tread of men
As great as those is shattering to the frame
Of such a little house Once left alone
You and I dear will go with softer steps
Up and down stairs and through the rooms and none
But sudden winds that snatch them from our hands
Will ever slam the doors
I think you see
More than you like to own to out that window
No for besides the things I tell you of
I only see the years They come and go
In alternation with the weeds the field
The wood
What kind of years
Why latter years
Different from early years
I see them too
You didnt count them
No the further off
So ran together that I didnt try to
It can scarce be that they would be in number
Wed care to know for we are not young now
And bang goes something else away off there
It sounds as if it were the men went down
And every crash meant one less to return
To lighted city streets we too have known
But now are giving up for country darkness
Come from that window where you see too much for me
And take a livelier view of things from here
Theyre going Watch this husky swarming up
Over the wheel into the skyhigh seat
Lighting his pipe now squinting down his nose
At the flame burning downward as he sucks it
See how it makes his noseside bright a proof
How dark its getting Can you tell what time
It is by that Or by the moon The new moon
What shoulder did I see her over Neither
A wire she is of silver as new as we
To everything Her light wont last us long
Its something though to know were going to have her
Night after night and stronger every night
To see us through our first two weeks But Joe
The stove Before they go Knock on the window
Ask them to help you get it on its feet
We stand here dreaming Hurry Call them back
Theyre not gone yet
Weve got to have the stove
Whatever else we want for And a light
Have we a piece of candle if the lamp
And oil are buried out of reach
Again
The house was full of tramping and the dark
Doorfilling men burst in and seized the stove
A cannonmouthlike hole was in the wall
To which they set it true by eye and then
Came up the jointed stovepipe in their hands
So much too light and airy for their strength
It almost seemed to come ballooning up
Slipping from clumsy clutches toward the ceiling
A fit said one and banged a stovepipe shoulder
Its good luck when you move in to begin
With good luck with your stovepipe Never mind
Its not so bad in the country settled down
When people re getting on in life Youll like it
Joe said You big boys ought to find a farm
And make good farmers and leave other fellows
The city work to do Theres not enough
For everybody as it is in there
God one said wildly and when no one spoke
Say that to Jimmy here He needs a farm
But Jimmy only made his jaw recede
Foollike and rolled his eyes as if to say
He saw himself a farmer Then there was a French boy
Who said with seriousness that made them laugh
Ma friend you aint know what it is youre ask
He doffed his cap and held it with both hands
Across his chest to make as twere a bow
Were giving you our chances on de farm
And then they all turned to with deafening boots
And put each other bodily out of the house
Goodby to them We puzzle them They think
I dont know what they think we see in what
They leave us to that pasture slope that seems
The back some farm presents us and your woods
To northward from your window at the sink
Waiting to steal a step on us whenever
We drop our eyes or turn to other things
As in the game ‘Tenstep the children play
Good boys they seemed and let them love the city
All they could say was ‘God when you proposed
Their coming out and making useful farmers
Did they make something lonesome go through you
It would take more than them to sicken you
Us of our bargain But they left us so
As to our fate like fools past reasoning with
They almost shook me
Its all so much
What we have always wanted I confess
Its seeming bad for a moment makes it seem
Even worse still and so on down down down
Its nothing its their leaving us at dusk
I never bore it well when people went
The first night after guests have gone the house
Seems haunted or exposed I always take
A personal interest in the locking up
At bedtime but the strangeness soon wears off
He fetched a dingy lantern from behind
A door Theres that we didnt lose And these
Some matches he unpocketed For food
The meals weve had no one can take from us
I wish that everything on earth were just
As certain as the meals weve had I wish
The meals we havent had were anyway
What have you you know where to lay your hands on
The bread we bought in passing at the store
Theres butter somewhere too
Lets rend the bread
Ill light the fire for company for you
Youll not have any other company
Till Ed begins to get out on a Sunday
To look us over and give us his idea
Of what wants pruning shingling breaking up
Hell know what he would do if he were we
And all at once Hell plan for us and plan
To help us but hell take it out in planning
Well you can set the table with the loaf
Lets see you find your loaf Ill light the fire
I like chairs occupying other chairs
Not offering a lady
There again Joe
Youre tired
Im drunknonsensical tired out
Dont mind a word I say Its a days work
To empty one house of all household goods
And fill another with em fifteen miles away
Although you do no more than dump them down
Dumped down in paradise we are and happy
Its all so much what I have always wanted
I cant believe its what you wanted too
Shouldnt you like to know
Id like to know
If it is what you wanted then how much
You wanted it for me
A troubled conscience
You dont want me to tell if I dont know
I dont want to find out what cant be known
But who first said the word to come
My dear
Its who first thought the thought Youre searching Joe
For things that dont exist I mean beginnings
Ends and beginningsthere are no such things
There are only middles
What is this
This life
Our sitting here by lanternlight together
Amid the wreckage of a former home
You wont deny the lantern isnt new
The stove is not and you are not to me
Nor I to you
Perhaps you never were
It would take me forever to recite
All thats not new in where we find ourselves
New is a word for fools in towns who think
Style upon style in dress and thought at last
Must get somewhere Ive heard you say as much
No this is no beginning
Then an end
End is a gloomy word
Is it too late
To drag you out for just a goodnight call
On the old peach trees on the knoll to grope
By starlight in the grass for a last peach
The neighbors may not have taken as their right
When the house wasnt lived in Ive been looking
I doubt if they have left us many grapes
Before we set ourselves to right the house
The first thing in the morning out we go
To go the round of apple cherry peach
Pine alder pasture mowing well and brook
All of a farm it is
I know this much
Im going to put you in your bed if first
I have to make you build it Come the light
When there was no more lantern in the kitchen
The fire got out through crannies in the stove
And danced in yellow wrigglers on the ceiling
As much at home as if theyd always danced there
A dented spider like a snow drop white
On a white Healall holding up a moth
Like a white piece of lifeless satin cloth
Saw ever curious eye so strange a sight
Portent in little assorted death and blight
Like the ingredients of a witches broth
The beady spider the flower like a froth
And the moth carried like a paper kite
What had that flower to do with being white
The blue prunella every childs delight
What brought the kindred spider to that height
Make we no thesis of the millers plight
What but design of darkness and of night
Design design Do I use the word aright
Anonymous submission
A dented spider like a snow drop white
On a white Healall holding up a moth
Like a white piece of lifeless satin cloth
Saw ever curious eye so strange a sight
Portent in little assorted death and blight
Like the ingredients of a witches broth
The beady spider the flower like a froth
And the moth carried like a paper kite
What had that flower to do with being white
The blue prunella every childs delight
What brought the kindred spider to that height
Make we no thesis of the millers plight
What but design of darkness and of night
Design design Do I use the word aright
One of my wishes is that those dark trees
So old and firm they scarcely show the breeze
Were not as twere the merest mask of gloom
But stretched away unto the edge of doom
I should not be withheld but that some day
into their vastness I should steal away
Fearless of ever finding open land
or highway where the slow wheel pours the sand
I do not see why I should eer turn back
Or those should not set forth upon my track
To overtake me who should miss me here
And long to know if still I held them dear
They would not find me changed from him they knew
Only more sure of all I though was true
Seek not in me the big I capital
Not yet the little dotted in me seek
If I have in me any I at all
Tis the iota subscript of the Greek
So small am I as an attention beggar
The letter you will find me subscript to
Is neither alpha eta nor omega
But upsilon which is the Greek for you
One misty evening one anothers guide
We two were groping down a Malvern side
The last wet fields and dripping hedges home
There came a moment of confusing lights
Such as according to belief in Rome
Were seen of old at Memphis on the heights
Before the fragments of a former sun
Could concentrate anew and rise as one
Light was a paste of pigment in our eyes
And then there was a moon and then a scene
So watery as to seem submarine
In which we two stood saturated drowned
The clovermingled rowan on the ground
Had taken all the water it could as dew
And still the air was saturated too
Its airy pressure turned to water weight
Then a small rainbow like a trellis gate
A very small moonmade prismatic bow
Stood closely over us through which to go
And then we were vouchsafed a miracle
That never yet to other two befell
And I alone of us have lived to tell
A wonder Bow and rainbow as it bent
Instead of moving with us as we went
To keep the pots of gold from being found
It lifted from its dewy pediment
Its two moteswimming manycolored ends
And gathered them together in a ring
And we stood in it softly circled round
From all division time or foe can bring
In a relation of elected friends
A trees leaves may be ever so good
So may its bar so may its wood
But unless you put the right thing to its root
It never will show much flower or fruit
But I may be one who does not care
Ever to have tree bloom or bear
Leaves for smooth and bark for rough
Leaves and bark may be tree enough
Some giant trees have bloom so small
They might as well have none at all
Late in life I have come on fern
Now lichens are due to have their turn
I bade men tell me which in brief
Which is fairer flower or leaf
They did not have the wit to say
Leaves by night and flowers by day
Leaves and bar leaves and bark
To lean against and hear in the dark
Petals I may have once pursued
Leaves are all my darker mood
As told to a child
When we locked up the house at night
We always locked the flowers outside
And cut them off from window light
The time I dreamed the door was tried
And brushed with buttons upon sleeves
The flowers were out there with the thieves
Yet nobody molested them
We did find one nasturtium
Upon the steps with bitten stem
I may have been to blame for that
I always thought it must have been
Some Hower I played with as I sat
At dusk to watch the moon down early
The rain to the wind said
You push and Ill pelt
They so smote the garden bed
That the flowers actually knelt
And lay lodged though not dead
I know how the flowers felt
The west was getting out of gold
The breath of air had died of cold
When shoeing home across the white
I thought I saw a bird alight
In summer when I passed the place
I had to stop and lift my face
A bird with an angelic gift
Was singing in it sweet and swift
No bird was singing in it now
A single leaf was on a bough
And that was all there was to see
In going twice around the tree
From my advantage on a hill
I judged that such a crystal chill
Was only adding frost to snow
As gilt to gold that wouldnt show
A brush had left a crooked stroke
Of what was either cloud or smoke
From north to south across the blue
A piercing little star was through
A stranger came to the door at eve
And he spoke the bridegroom fair
He bore a greenwhite stick in his hand
And for all burden care
He asked with the eyes more than the lips
For a shelter for the night
And he turned and looked at the road afar
Without a window light
The bridegroom came forth into the porch
With Let us look at the sky
And question what of the night to be
Stranger you and I
The woodbine leaves littered the yard
The woodbine berries were blue
Autumn yes winter was in the wind
Stranger I wish I knew
Within the bride in the dusk alone
Bent over the open fire
Her face rosered with the glowing coal
And the thought of the hearts desire
The bridegroom looked at the weary road
Yet saw but her within
And wished her heart in a case of gold
And pinned with a silver pin
The bridegroom thought it little to give
A dole of bread a purse
A heartfelt prayer for the poor of God
Or for the rich a curse
But whether or not a man was asked
To mar the love of two
By harboring woe in the bridal house
The bridegroom wished he knew
Her teachers certainty it must be Mabel
Made Maple first take notice of her name
She asked her father and he told her Maple
Maple is right
But teacher told the school
Theres no such name
Teachers dont know as much
As fathers about children you tell teacher
You tell her that its MAPLE
You ask her if she knows a maple tree
Well you were named after a maple tree
Your mother named you You and she just saw
Each other in passing in the room upstairs
One coming this way into life and one
Going the other out of lifeyou know
So you cant have much recollection of her
She had been having a long look at you
She put her finger in your cheek so hard
It must have made your dimple there and said
Maple I said it too Yes for her name
She nodded So were sure theres no mistake
I dont know what she wanted it to mean
But it seems like some word she left to bid you
Be a good girlbe like a maple tree
How like a maple trees for us to guess
Or for a little girl to guess sometime
Not nowat least I shouldnt try too hard now
By and by I will tell you all I know
About the different trees and something too
About your mother that perhaps may help
Dangerous selfarousing words to sow
Luckily all she wanted of her name then
Was to rebuke her teacher with it next day
And give the teacher a scare as from her father
Anything further had been wasted on her
Or so he tried to think to avoid blame
She would forget it She all but forgot it
What he sowed with her slept so long a sleep
And came so near death in the dark of years
That when it woke and came to life again
The flower was different from the parent seed
It carne back vaguely at the glass one day
As she stood saying her name over aloud
Striking it gently across her lowered eyes
To make it go well with the way she looked
What was it about her name Its strangeness lay
In having too much meaning Other names
As Lesley Carol Irma Marjorie
Signified nothing Rose could have a meaning
But hadnt as it went She knew a Rose
This difference from other names it was
Made people notice itand notice her
They either noticed it or got it wrong
Her problem was to find out what it asked
In dress or manner of the girl who bore it
If she could form some notion of her mother
What she bad thought was lovely and what good
This was her mothers childhood home
The house one story high in front three stories
On the end it presented to the road
The arrangement made a pleasant sunny cellar
Her mothers bedroom was her fathers still
Where she could watch her mothers picture fading
Once she found for a bookmark in the Bible
A maple leaf she thought must have been laid
In wait for her there She read every word
Of the two pages it was pressed between
As if it was her mother speaking to her
But forgot to put the leaf back in closing
And lost the place never to read again
She was sure though there had been nothing in it
So she looked for herself as everyone
Looks for himself more or less outwardly
And her selfseeking fitful though it was
May still have been what led her on to read
And think a little and get some city schooling
She learned shorthand whatever shorthand may
Have had to do with it she sometimes wondered
So till she found herself in a strange place
For the name Maple to have brought her to
Taking dictation on a paper pad
And in the pauses when she raised her eyes
Watching out of a nineteenth story window
An airship laboring with unshiplike motion
And a vague alldisturbing roar above the river
Beyond the highest city built with hands
Someone was saying in such natural tones
She almost wrote the words down on her knee
Do you know you remind me of a tree
A maple tree
Because my name is Maple
Isnt it Mabel I thought it was Mabel
No doubt youve heard the office call me Mabel
I have to let them call me what they like
They were both stirred that he should have divined
Without the name her personal mystery
It made it seem as if there must be something
She must have missed herself So they were married
And took the fancy home with them to live by
They went on pilgrimage once to her fathers
The house one story high in front three stories
On the side it presented to the road
To see if there was not some special tree
She might have overlooked They could find none
Not so much as a single tree for shade
Let alone grove of trees for sugar orchard
She told him of the bookmark maple leaf
In the big Bible and all she remembered
of the place marked with itWave offering
Something about wave offering it said
Youve never asked your father outright have you
I have and been Put off sometime I think
This was her faded memory of the way
Once long ago her father had put himself off
Because no telling but it may have been
Something between your father and your mother
Not meant for us at all
Not meant for me
Where would the fairness be in giving me
A name to carry for life and never know
The secret of
And then it may have been
Something a father couldnt tell a daughter
As well as could a mother And again
It may have been their one lapse into fancy
Twould be too bad to make him sorry for
By bringing it up to him when be was too old
Your father feels us round him with our questing
And holds us off unnecessarily
As if he didnt know what little thing
Might lead us on to a discovery
It was as personal as be could be
About the way he saw it was with you
To say your mother bad she lived would be
As far again as from being born to bearing
Just one look more with what you say in mind
And I give up which last look came to nothing
But though they now gave up the search forever
They clung to what one had seen in the other
By inspiration It proved there was something
They kept their thoughts away from when the maples
Stood uniform in buckets and the steam
Of sap and snow rolled off the sugarhouse
When they made her related to the maples
It was the tree the autumn fire ran through
And swept of leathern leaves but left the bark
Unscorched unblackened even by any smoke
They always took their holidays in autumn
Once they came on a maple in a glade
Standing alone with smooth arms lifted up
And every leaf of foliage shed worn
Laid scarlet and pale pink about her feet
But its age kept them from considering this one
Twentyfive years ago at Maples naming
It hardly could have been a twoleaved seedling
The next cow might have licked up out at pasture
Could it have been another maple like it
They hovered for a moment near discovery
Figurative enough to see the symbol
But lacking faith in anything to mean
The same at different times to different people
Perhaps a filial diffidence partly kept them
From thinking it could be a thing so bridal
And anyway it came too late for Maple
She used her hands to cover up her eyes
We would not see the secret if we could now
We are not looking for it any more
Thus had a name with meaning given in death
Made a girls marriage and ruled in her life
No matter that the meaning was not clear
A name with meaning could bring up a child
Taking the child out of the parents hands
Better a meaningless name I should say
As leaving more to nature and happy chance
Name children some names and see what you do
As I went down the hill along the wall
There was a gate I had leaned at for the view
And had just turned from when I first saw you
As you came up the hill We met But all
We did that day was mingle great and small
Footprints in summer dust as if we drew
The figure of our being less than two
But more than one as yet Your parasol
Pointed the decimal off with one deep thrust
And all the time we talked you seemed to see
Something down there to smile at in the dust
Oh it was without prejudice to me
Afterward I went past what you had passed
Before we met and you what I had passed
Something there is that doesnt love a wall
That sends the frozengroundswell under it
And spills the upper boulders in the sun
And makes gaps even two can pass abreast
The work of hunters is another thing
I have come after them and made repair
Where they have left not one stone on a stone
But they would have the rabbit out of hiding
To please the yelping dogs The gaps I mean
No one has seen them made or heard them made
But at spring mendingtime we find them there
I let my neighbour know beyond the hill
And on a day we meet to walk the line
And set the wall between us once again
We keep the wall between us as we go
To each the boulders that have fallen to each
And some are loaves and some so nearly balls
We have to use a spell to make them balance
Stay where you are until our backs are turned
We wear our fingers rough with handling them
Oh just another kind of outdoor game
One on a side It comes to little more
There where it is we do not need the wall
He is all pine and I am apple orchard
My apple trees will never get across
And eat the cones under his pines I tell him
He only says Good fences make good neighbours
Spring is the mischief in me and I wonder
If I could put a notion in his head
Why do they make good neighbours Isnt it
Where there are cows But here there are no cows
Before I built a wall Id ask to know
What I was walling in or walling out
And to whom I was like to give offence
Something there is that doesnt love a wall
That wants it down I could say Elves to him
But its not elves exactly and Id rather
He said it for himself I see him there
Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top
In each hand like an oldstone savage armed
He moves in darkness as it seems to me
Not of woods only and the shade of trees
He will not go behind his fathers saying
And he likes having thought of it so well
He says again Good fences make good neighbours
All crying We will go with you O Wind
The foliage follow him leaf and stem
But a sleep oppresses them as they go
And they end by bidding them as they go
And they end by bidding him stay with them
Since ever they flung abroad in spring
The leaves had promised themselves this flight
Who now would fain seek sheltering wall
Or thicket or hollow place for the night
And now they answer his summoning blast
With an ever vaguer and vaguer stir
Or at utmost a little reluctant whirl
That drops them no further than where they were
I only hope that when I am free
As they are free to go in quest
Of the knowledge beyond the bounds of life
It may not seem better to me to rest
There was never a sound beside the wood but one
And that was my long scythe whispering to the ground
What was it it whispered I knew not well myself
Perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun
Something perhaps about the lack of sound
And that was why it whispered and did not speak
It was no dream of the gift of idle hours
Or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf
Anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak
To the earnest love that laid the swale in rows
Not without feeblepointed spikes of flowers
Pale orchises and scared a bright green snake
The fact is the sweetest dream that labour knows
My long scythe whispered and left the hay to make
Thine emulous fond flowers are dead too
And the daft sunassaulter he
That frighted thee so oft is fled or dead
Save only me
Nor is it sad to thee
Save only me
There is none left to mourn thee in the fields
The gray grass is not dappled with the snow
Its two banks have not shut upon the river
But it is long ago
It seems forever
Since first I saw thee glance
With all the dazzling other ones
In airy dalliance
Precipitate in love
Tossed tangled whirled and whirled above
Like a limp rosewreath in a fairy dance
When that was the soft mist
Of my regret hung not on all the land
And I was glad for thee
And glad for me I wist
Thou didst not know who tottered wandering on high
That fate had made thee for the pleasure of the wind
With those great careless wings
Nor yet did I
And there were other things
It seemed God let thee flutter from his gentle clasp
Then fearful he had let thee win
Too far beyond him to be gathered in
Snatched thee oer eager with ungentle grasp
Ah I remember me
How once conspiracy was rife
Against my life
The languor of it and the dreaming fond
Surging the grasses dizzied me of thought
The breeze three odors brought
And a gemflower waved in a wand
Then when I was distraught
And could not speak
Sidelong full on my cheek
What should that reckless zephyr fling
But the wild touch of thy dyedusty wing
I found that wing broken today
For thou are dead I said
And the strange birds say
I found it with the withered leaves
Under the eaves
My Sorrow when shes here with me
Thinks these dark days of autumn rain
Are beautiful as days can be
She loves the bare the withered tree
She walks the sodden pasture lane
Her pleasure will not let me stay
She talks and I am fain to list
Shes glad the birds are gone away
Shes glad her simple worsted grey
Is silver now with clinging mist
The desolate deserted trees
The faded earth the heavy sky
The beauties she so truly sees
She thinks I have no eye for these
And vexes me for reason why
Not yesterday I learned to know
The love of bare November days
Before the coming of the snow
But it were vain to tell her so
And they are better for her praise
The people along the sand
All turn and look one way
They turn their back on the land
They look at the sea all day
As long as it takes to pass
A ship keeps raising its hull
The wetter ground like glass
Reflects a standing gull
The land may vary more
But wherever the truth may be
The water comes ashore
And the people look at the sea
They cannot look out far
They cannot look in deep
But when was that ever a bar
To any watch they keep
He would declare and could himself believe
That the birds there in all the garden round
From having heard the daylong voice of Eve
Had added to their own an oversound
Her tone of meaning but without the words
Admittedly an eloquence so soft
Could only have had an influence on birds
When call or laughter carried it aloft
Be that as may be she was in their song
Moreover her voice upon their voices crossed
Had now persisted in the woods so long
That probably it never would be lost
Never again would birds song be the same
And to do that to birds was why she came
I met a lady from the South who said
You wont believe she said it but she said it
None of my family ever worked or had
A thing to sell I dont suppose the work
Much matters You may work for all of me
Ive seen the time Ive had to work myself
The having anything to sell is what
Is the disgrace in man or state or nation
I met a traveler from Arkansas
Who boasted of his state as beautiful
For diamonds and apples Diamonds
And apples in commercial quantities
I asked him on my guard Oh yes he answered
Off his The time was evening in the Pullman
I see the porters made your bed I told him
I met a Californian who would
Talk Californiaa state so blessed
He said in climate none bad ever died there
A natural death and Vigilance Committees
Had had to organize to stock the graveyards
And vindicate the states humanity
Just the way Stefansson runs on I murmured
About the British Arctic Thats what comes
Of being in the market with a climate
I met a poet from another state
A zealot full of fluid inspiration
Who in the name of fluid inspiration
But in the best style of bad salesmanship
Angrily tried to male me write a protest
In verse I think against the Volstead Act
He didnt even offer me a drink
Until I asked for one to steady him
This is called having an idea to sell
It never could have happened in New Hampshire
The only person really soiled with trade
I ever stumbled on in old New Hampshire
Was someone who had just come back ashamed
From selling things in California
Hed built a noble mansard roof with balls
On turrets like Constantinople deep
In woods some ten miles from a railroad station
As if to put forever out of mind
The hope of being as we say received
I found him standing at the close of day
Inside the threshold of his open barn
Like a lone actor on a gloomy stage
And recognized him through the iron gray
In which his face was muffled to the eyes
As an old boyhood friend and once indeed
A drover with me on the road to Brighton
His farm was grounds and not a farm at all
His house among the local sheds and shanties
Rose like a factors at a trading station
And be was rich and I was still a rascal
I couldnt keep from asking impolitely
Where bad he been and what had he been doing
How did he get so Rich was understood
In dealing in old rags in San Francisco
Ob it was terrible as well could be
We both of us turned over in our graves
Just specimens is all New Hampshire has
One each of everything as in a showcase
Which naturally she doesnt care to sell
She had one President Pronounce him Purse
And make the most of it for better or worse
Hes your one chance to score against the state
She had one Daniel Webster He was all
The Daniel Webster ever was or shall be
She had the Dartmouth needed to produce him
I call her old She has one family
Whose claim is good to being settled here
Before the era of colonization
And before that of exploration even
John Smith remarked them as be coasted by
Dangling their legs and fishing off a wharf
At the Isles of Shoals and satisfied himself
They werent Red Indians but veritable
Preprimitives of the white race dawn people
Like those who furnished Adams sons with wives
However uninnocent they may have been
In being there so early in our history
Theyd been there then a hundred years or more
Pity he didnt ask what they were up to
At that date with a wharf already built
And take their name Theyve since told me their name
Today an honored one in Nottingham
As for what they were up to more than fishing
Suppose they werent behaving Puritanly
The hour bad not yet struck for being good
Mankind had not yet gone on the Sabbatical
It became an explorer of the deep
Not to explore too deep in others business
Did you but know of him New Hampshire has
One real reformer who would change the world
So it would be accepted by two classes
Artists the minute they set up as artists
Before that is they are themselves accepted
And boys the minute they get out of college
I cant help thinking those are tests to go by
And she has one I dont know what to call him
Who comes from Philadelphia every year
With a great flock of chickens of rare breeds
He wants to give the educational
Advantages of growing almost wild
Under the watchful eye of hawk and eagle
Dorkings because theyre spoken of by Chaucer
Sussex because theyre spoken of by Herrick
She has a touch of gold New Hampshire gold
You may have heard of it I had a farm
Offered me not long since up Berlin way
With a mine on it that was worked for gold
But not gold in commercial quantities
Just enough gold to make the engagement rings
And marriage rings of those who owned the farm
What gold more innocent could one have asked for
One of my children ranging after rocks
Lately brought home from Andover or Canaan
A specimen of beryl with a trace
Of radium I know with radium
The trace would have to be the merest trace
To be below the threshold of commercial
But trust New Hampshire not to have enough
Of radium or anything to sell
A specimen of everything I said
She has one witchold style She lives in Colebrook
The only other witch I ever met
Was lately at a cutglass dinner in Boston
There were four candles and four people present
The witch was young and beautiful new style
And openminded She was free to question
Her gift for reading letters locked in boxes
Why was it so much greater when the boxes
Were metal than it was when they were wooden
It made the world seem so mysterious
The Sciety for Psychical Research
Was cognizant Her husband was worth millions
I think he owned some shares in Harvard College
New Hampshire used to have at Salem
A company we called the White Corpuscles
Whose duty was at any hour of night
To rush in sheets and fools caps where they smelled
A thing the least bit doubtfully perscented
And give someone the Skipper Iresons Ride
One each of everything as in a showcase
More than enough land for a specimen
Youll say she has but there there enters in
Something else to protect her from herself
There quality makes up for quantity
Not even New Hampshire farms are much for sale
The farm I made my home on in the mountains
1 had to take by force rather than buy
I caught the owner outdoors by himself
Rakingup after winter and I said
Im going to put you off this farm I want it
Where are you going to put me In the road
Im going to put you on the farm next to it
Why wont the farm next to it do for you
I like this better It was really better
Apples New Hampshire has them but unsprayed
With no suspicion in stern end or blossom end
Of vitriol or arsenate of lead
And so not good for anything but cider
Her unpruned grapes are flung like lariats
Far up the birches out of reach of man
A state producing precious metals stones
Andwriting none of these except perhaps
The precious literature in quantity
Or quality to worry the producer
About disposing of it Do you know
Considering the market there are more
Poems produced than any other thing
No wonder poets sometimes have to seem
So much more businesslike than businessmen
Their wares are so much harder to get rid of
Shes one of the two best states in the Union
Vermonts the other And the two have been
Yokefellows in the sap yoke from of old
In many Marches And they lie like wedges
Thick end to thin end and thin end to thick end
And are a figure of the way the strong
Of mind and strong of arm should fit together
One thick where one is thin and vice versa
New Hampshire raises the Connecticut
In a trout hatchery near Canada
But soon divides the river with Vermont
Both are delightful states for their absurdly
Small townsLost Nation Bungey Muddy Boo
Poplin Still Corners so called not because
The place is silent all day long nor yet
Because it boasts a whisky stillbecause
It set out once to be a city and still
Is only corners crossroads in a wood
And I remember one whose name appeared
Between the pictures on a movie screen
Election night once in Franconia
When everything had gone Republican
And Democrats were sore in need of comfort
Easton goes Democratic Wilson 4
Hughes 2 And everybody to the saddest
Laughed the loud laugh the big laugh at the little
New York five million laughs at Manchester
Manchester sixty or seventy thousand laughs
At Littleton four thousand Littleton
Laughs at Franconia seven hundred and
Franconia laughs I feardid laugh that night­
At Easton What has Easton left to laugh at
And like the actress exclaim Oh my God at
Theres Bungey and for Bungey there are towns
Whole townships named but without population
Anything I can say about New Hampshire
Will serve almost as well about Vermont
Excepting that they differ in their mountains
The Vermont mountains stretch extended straight
New Hampshire mountains Curl up in a coil
I had been coming to New Hampshire mountains
And here I am and what am I to say
Here first my theme becomes embarrassing
Emerson said The God who made New Hampshire
Taunted the lofty land with little men
Anotner Massachusetts poet said
I go no more to summer in New Hampshire
Ive given up my summer place in Dublin
But when I asked to know what ailed New Hampshire
She said she couldnt stand the people in it
The little men its Massachusetts speaking
And when I asked to know what ailed the people
She said Go read your own books and find out
I may as well confess myself the author
Of several books against the world in general
To take them as against a special state
Or even nations to restrict my meaning
Im what is called a sensibilitist
Or otherwise an environmentalist
I refuse to adapt myself a mite
To any change from hot to cold from wet
To dry from poor to rich or back again
I make a virtue of my suffering
From nearly everything that goes on round me
In other words I know wherever I am
Being the creature of literature I am
1 sball not lack for pain to keep me awake
Kit Marlowe taught me how to say my prayers
Why this is Hell nor am I out of it
Samoa Russia Ireland I complain of
No less than England France and Italy
Because I wrote my novels in New Hampshire
Is no proof that I aimed them at New Hampshire
When I left Massachusetts years ago
Between two days the reason why I sought
New Hampshire not Connecticut
Rhode Island New York or Vermont was this
Where I was living then New Hampshire offered
The nearest boundary to escape across
I hadnt an illusion in my handbag
About the people being better there
Than those I left behind I thought they werent
I thought they couldnt be And yet they were
Id sure had no such friends in Massachusetts
As Hall of Windham Gay of Atkinson
Bartlett of Raymond now of Colorado
Harris of Derry and Lynch of Bethlehem
The glorious bards of Massachusetts seem
To want to make New Hampshire people over
They taunt the lofty land with little men
I dont know what to say about the people
For arts sake one could almost wish them worse
Rather than better How are we to write
The Russian novel in America
As long as life goes so unterribly
There is the pinch from which our only outcry
In literature to date is heard to come
We get what little misery we can
Out of not having cause for misery
It makes the guild of novel writers sick
To be expected to be Dostoievskis
On nothing worse than too much luck and comfort
This is not sorrow though its just the vapors
And recognized as such in Russia itself
Under the new regime and so forbidden
If well it is with Russia then feel free
To say so or be stood against the wall
And shot Its Pollyanna now or death
This then is the new freedom we hear tell of
And very sensible No state can build
A literature that shall at once be sound
And sad on a foundation of wellbeing
To show the level of intelligence
Among us it was just a Warren farmer
Whose horse had pulled him short up in the road
By me a stranger This is what he said
From nothing but embarrassment and want
Of anything more sociable to say
You hear those bound dogs sing on Moosilauke
Well they remind me of the hue and cry
Weve heard against the Mid Victorians
And never rightly understood till Bryan
Retired from politics and joined the chorus
The matter with the MidVictorians
Seems to have been a man named Joh n L Darwin
Go long I said to him he to his horse
I knew a man who failing as a farmer
Burned down his farmhouse for the fire insurance
And spent the proceeds on a telescope
To satisfy a lifelong curiosity
About our place among the infinities
And how was that for otherworldliness
If I must choose which I would elevate
The people or the already lofty mountains
Id elevate the already lofty mountains
The only fault I find with old New Hampshire
Is that her mountains arent quite high enough
I was not always so Ive come to be so
How to my sorrow how have I attained
A height from which to look down critical
On mountains What has given me assurance
To say what height becomes New Hampshire mountains
Or any mountains Can it be some strength
I feel as of an earthquake in my back
To heave them higher to the morning star
Can it be foreign travel in the Alps
Or having seen and credited a moment
The solid molding of vast peaks of cloud
Behind the pitiful reality
Of Lincoln Lafayette and Liberty
Or some such sense as says bow high shall jet
The fountain in proportion to the basin
No none of these has raised me to my throne
Of intellectual dissatisfaction
But the sad accident of having seen
Our actual mountains given in a map
Of early times as twice the height they are
Ten thousand feet instead of only five
Which shows how sad an accident may be
Five thousand is no longer high enough
Whereas I never had a good idea
About improving people in the world
Here I am overfertile in suggestion
And cannot rest from planning day or night
How high Id thrust the peaks in summer snow
To tap the upper sky and draw a flow
Of frosty night air on the vale below
Down from the stars to freeze the dew as starry
The more the sensibilitist I am
The more I seem to want my mountains wild
The way the wiry gangboss liked the logjam
After hed picked the lock and got it started
He dodged a log that lifted like an arm
Against the sky to break his back for him
Then came in dancing skipping with his life
Across the roar and chaos and the words
We saw him say along the zigzag journey
Were doubtless as the words we heard him say
On coming nearer Wasnt she an ideal
Sonofabitch You bet she was an ideal
For all her mountains fall a little short
Her people not quite short enough for Art
Shes still New Hampshire a most restful state
Lately in converse with a New York alec
About the new school of the pseudophallic
I found myself in a close corner where
I bad to make an almost funny choice
Choose you which you will bea prude or puke
Mewling and puking in the public arms
Me for the hills where I dont have to choose
But if you bad to choose which would you be
1 wouldnt be a prude afraid of nature
I know a man who took a double ax
And went alone against a grove of trees
But his heart failing him he dropped the ax
And ran for shelter quoting Matthew Arnold
Nature is cruel man is sick of blood
There s been enough shed without shedding mine
Remember Birnam Wood The woods in flux
He had a special terror of the flux
That showed itself in dendrophobia
The only decent tree had been to mill
And educated into boards be said
He knew too well for any earthly use
The line where man leaves off and nature starts
And never overstepped it save in dreams
He stood on the safe side of the line talking
Which is sheer Matthew Arnoldism
The cult of one who owned himself a foiled
Circuitous wanderer and took dejectedly
His seat upon the intellectual throne
Agreed in frowning on these improvised
Altars the woods are full of nowadays
Again as in the days when Ahaz sinned
By worship under green trees in the open
Scarcely a mile but that I come on one
A blackchecked stone and stick of rainwashed charcoal
Even to say the groves were Gods first temples
Comes too near to Ahaz sin for safety
Nothing not built with hands of course is sacred
But here is not a question of whats sacred
Rather of what to face or run away from
Id hate to be a runaway from nature
And neither would I choose to be a puke
Who cares not what be does in company
And when he cant do anything falls back
On words and tries his worst to make words speak
Louder than actions and sometimes achieves it
It seems a narrow choice the age insists on
8ow about being a good Greek for instance
That course they tell me isnt offered this year
Come but this isnt choosingpuke or prude
Well if I have to choose one or the other
I choose to be a plain New Hampshire farmer
With an income in cash of say a thousand
From say a publisher in New York City
Its restful to arrive at a decision
And restful just to think about New Hampshire
At present I am living in Vermont
They sent him back to her The letter came
Saying And she could have him And before
She could be sure there was no hidden ill
Under the formal writing he was in her sight
Living They gave him back to her alive
How else They are not known to send the dead
And not disfigured visibly His face
His hands She had to look and ask
What was it dear And she had given all
And still she had all they had they the lucky
Wasn’t she glad now Everything seemed won
And all the rest for them permissible ease
She had to ask What was it dear
Enough
Yet not enough A bullet through and through
High in the breast Nothing but what good care
And medicine and rest and you a week
Can cure me of to go again The same
Grim giving to do over for them both
She dared no more than ask him with her eyes
How was it with him for a second trial
And with his eyes he asked her not to ask
They had given him back to her but not to keep
Natures first green is gold
Her hardest hue to hold
Her early leafs a flower
But only so an hour
Then leaf subsides to leaf
So Eden sank to grief
So dawn goes down to day
Nothing gold can stay
Now close the windows and hush all the fields
If the trees must let them silently toss
No bird is singing now and if there is
Be it my loss
It will be long ere the marshes resume
I will be long ere the earliest bird
So close the windows and not hear the wind
But see all windstirred
O hushed October morning mild
Thy leaves have ripened to the fall
Tomorrows wind if it be wild
Should waste them all
The crows above the forest call
Tomorrow they may form and go
O hushed October morning mild
Begin the hours of this day slow
Make the day seem to us less brief
Hearts not averse to being beguiled
Beguile us in the way you know
Release one leaf at break of day
At noon release another leaf
One from our trees one far away
Retard the sun with gentle mist
Enchant the land with amethyst
Slow slow
For the grapes sake if the were all
Whose elaves already are burnt with frost
Whose clustered fruit must else be lost
For the grapes sake along the all
To hear us talk
The tree the tempest with a crash of wood
Throws down in front of us is not bar
Our passage to our journeys end for good
But just to ask us who we think we are
Insisting always on our own way so
She likes to halt us in our runner tracks
And make us get down in a foot of snow
Debating what to do without an ax
And yet she knows obstruction is in vain
We will not be put off the final goal
We have it hidden in us to attain
Not though we have to seize earth by the pole
And tired of aimless circling in one place
Steer straight off after something into space
Youll wait a long long time for anything much
To happen in heaven beyond the floats of cloud
And the Northern Lights that run like tingling nerves
The sun and moon get crossed but they never touch
Nor strike out fire from each other nor crash out loud
The planets seem to interfere in their curves
But nothing ever happens no harm is done
We may as well go patiently on with our life
And look elsewhere than to stars and moon and sun
For the shocks and changes we need to keep us sane
It is true the longest drout will end in rain
The longest peace in China will end in strife
Still it wouldnt reward the watcher to stay awake
In hopes of seeing the calm of heaven break
On his particular time and personal sight
That calm seems certainly safe to last tonight
The shattered water made a misty din
Great waves looked over others coming in
And thought of doing something to the shore
That water never did to land before
The clouds were low and hairy in the skies
Like locks blown forward in the gleam of eyes
You could not tell and yet it looked as if
The shore was lucky in being backed by cliff
The cliff in being backed by continent
It looked as if a night of dark intent
Was coming and not only a night an age
Someone had better be prepared for rage
There would be more than oceanwater broken
Before Gods last Put out the light was spoken
The buzzsaw snarled and rattled in the yard
And made dust and dropped stovelength sticks of wood
Sweetscented stuff when the breeze drew across it
And from there those that lifted eyes could count
Five mountain ranges one behind the other
Under the sunset far into Vermont
And the saw snarled and rattled snarled and rattled
As it ran light or had to bear a load
And nothing happened day was all but done
Call it a day I wish they might have said
To please the boy by giving him the half hour
That a boy counts so much when saved from work
His sister stood beside them in her apron
To tell them Supper At that word the saw
As if to prove saws knew what supper meant
Leaped out at the boys hand or seemed to leap
He must have given the hand However it was
Neither refused the meeting But the hand
The boys first outcry was a rueful laugh
As he swung toward them holding up the hand
Half in appeal but half as if to keep
The life from spilling Then the boy saw all
Since he was old enough to know big boy
Doing a mans work though a child at heart
He saw all spoiled Dont let him cut my hand off
The doctor when he comes Dont let him sister
So But the hand was gone already
The doctor put him in the dark of ether
He lay and puffed his lips out with his breath
And then the watcher at his pulse took fright
No one believed They listened at his heart
Little less nothing and that ended it
No more to build on there And they since they
Were not the one dead turned to their affairs
PAN came out of the woods one day
His skin and his hair and his eyes were gray
The gray of the moss of walls were they
And stood in the sun and looked his fill
At wooded valley and wooded hill

He stood in the zephyr pipes in hand
On a height of naked pasture land
In all the country he did command
He saw no smoke and he saw no roof
That was well and he stamped a hoof

His heart knew peace for none came here
To this lean feeding save once a year
Someone to salt the halfwild steer
Or homespun children with clicking pails
Who see no little they tell no tales

He tossed his pipes too hard to teach
A newworld song far out of reach
For a sylvan sign that the blue jay’s screech
And the whimper of hawks beside the sun
Were music enough for him for one

Times were changed from what they were
Such pipes kept less of power to stir
The fruited bough of the juniper
And the fragile bluets clustered there
Than the merest aimless breath of air

They were pipes of pagan mirth
And the world had found new terms of worth
He laid him down on the sunburned earth
And ravelled a flower and looked away
Play Play What should he play
To drive Paul out of any lumber camp
All that was needed was to say to him
How is the wife Paul and hed disappear
Some said it was because be bad no wife
And hated to be twitted on the subject
Others because hed come within a day
Or so of having one and then been Jilted
Others because hed had one once a good one
Whod run away with someone else and left him
And others still because he had one now
He only had to be reminded of
He was all duty to her in a minute
He had to run right off to look her up
As if to say Thats so how is my wife
I hope she isnt getting into mischief
No one was anxious to get rid of Paul
Hed been the hero of the mountain camps
Ever since just to show them he bad slipped
The bark of a whole tamarack off whole
As clean as boys do off a willow twig
To make a willow whistle on a Sunday
April by subsiding meadow brooks
They seemed to ask him just to see him go
How is the wife Paul and he always went
He never stopped to murder anyone
Who asked the question He just disappeared
Nobody knew in what direction
Although it wasnt usually long
Before they beard of him in some new camp
The same Paul at the same old feats of logging
The question everywhere was why should Paul
Object to being asked a civil question
A man you could say almost anything to
Short of a fighting word You have the answers
And there was one more not so fair to Paul
That Paul had married a wife not his equal
Paul was ashamed of her To match a hero
She would have had to be a heroine
Instead of which she was some halfbreed squaw
But if the story Murphy told was true
She wasnt anything to be ashamed of
You know Paul could do wonders Everyones
Heard how he thrashed the horses on a load
That wouldnt budge until they simply stretched
Their rawhide harness from the load to camp
Paul told the boss the load would be all right
The sun will bring your load in and it did
By shrinking the rawhide to natural length
Thats what is called a stretcher But I guess
The one about his jumping sos to land
With both his feet at once against the ceiling
And then land safely right side up again
Back on the floor is fact or pretty near fact
Well this is such a yarn Paul sawed his wife
Out of a whitepine log Murphy was there
And as you might say saw the lady born
Paul worked at anything in lumbering
Hed been bard at it taking boards away
For I forget the last ambitious sawyer
To want to find out if he couldnt pile
The lumber on Paul till Paul begged for mercy
Theyd sliced the first slab off a big butt log
And the sawyer had slammed the carriage back
To slam endon again against the saw teeth
To judge them by the way they caught themselves
When they saw what had happened to the log
They must have had a guilty expectation
Something was going to go with their slambanging
Something bad left a broad black streak of grease
On the new wood the whole length of the log
Except perhaps a foot at either end
But when Paul put his finger in the grease
It wasnt grease at all but a long slot
The log was hollow They were sawing pine
First time I ever saw a hollow pine
That comes of having Paul around the place
Take it to bell for me the sawyer said
Everyone had to have a look at it
And tell Paul what he ought to do about it
They treated it as his You take a jackknife
And spread the opening and youve got a dugout
All dug to go afishing in To Paul
The hollow looked too sound and clean and empty
Ever to have housed birds or beasts or bees
There was no entrance for them to get in by
It looked to him like some new kind of hollow
He thought hed better take his jackknife to
So after work that evening be came back
And let enough light into it by cutting
To see if it was empty He made out in there
A slender length of pith or was it pith
It might have been the skin a snake had cast
And left stood up on end inside the tree
The hundred years the tree must have been growing
More cutting and he bad this in both hands
And looking from it to the pond nearby
Paul wondered how it would respond to water
Not a breeze stirred but just the breath of air
He made in walking slowly to the beach
Blew it once off his hands and almost broke it
He laid it at the edge where it could drink
At the first drink it rustled and grew limp
At the next drink it grew invisible
Paul dragged the shallows for it with his fingers
And thought it must have melted It was gone
And then beyond the open water dim with midges
Where the log drive lay pressed against the boom
It slowly rose a person rose a girl
Her wet hair heavy on her like a helmet
Who leaning on a log looked back at Paul
And that made Paul in turn look back
To see if it was anyone behind him
That she was looking at instead of him
Murphy had been there watching all the time
But from a shed where neither of them could see him
There was a moment of suspense in birth
When the girl seemed too waterlogged to live
Before she caught her first breath with a gasp
And laughed Then she climbed slowly to her feet
And walked off talking to herself or Paul
Across the logs like backs of alligators
Paul taking after her around the pond
Next evening Murphy and some other fellows
Got drunk and tracked the pair up Catamount
From the bare top of which there is a view
TO other hills across a kettle valley
And there well after dark let Murphy tell it
They saw Paul and his creature keeping house
It was the only glimpse that anyone
Has had of Paul and her since Murphy saw them
Falling in love across the twilight millpond
More than a mile across the wilderness
They sat together halfway up a cliff
In a small niche let into it the girl
Brightly as if a star played on the place
Paul darkly like her shadow All the light
Was from the girl herself though not from a star
As was apparent from what happened next
All those great ruffians put their throats together
And let out a loud yell and threw a bottle
As a brute tribute of respect to beauty
Of course the bottle fell short by a mile
But the shout reached the girl and put her light out
She went out like a firefly and that was all
So there were witnesses that Paul was married
And not to anyone to be ashamed of
Everyone had been wrong in judging Paul
Murphy told me Paul put on all those airs
About his wife to keep her to himself
Paul was whats called a terrible possessor
Owning a wife with him meant owning her
She wasnt anybody elses business
Either to praise her or much as name her
And hed thank people not to think of her
Murphys idea was that a man like Paul
Wouldnt be spoken to about a wife
In any way the world knew how to speak
I WALKED down alone Sunday after church
To the place where John has been cutting trees
To see for myself about the birch
He said I could have to bush my peas
The sun in the newcut narrow gap
Was hot enough for the first of May
And stifling hot with the odor of sap
From stumps still bleeding their life away
The frogs that were peeping a thousand shrill
Wherever the ground was low and wet
The minute they heard my step went still
To watch me and see what I came to get
Birch boughs enough piled everywhere
All fresh and sound from the recent axe
Time someone came with cart and pair
And got them off the wild flowers backs
They might be good for garden things
To curl a little finger round
The same as you seize catscradle strings
And lift themselves up off the ground
Small good to anything growing wild
They were crooking many a trillium
That had budded before the boughs were piled
And since it was coming up had to come
Nothing to say to all those marriages
She had made three herself to three of his
The score was even for them three to three
But come to die she found she cared so much
She thought of children in a burial row
Three children in a burial row were sad
One mans three women in a burial row
Somehow made her impatient with the man
And so she said to Laban You have done
A good deal right dont do the last thing wrong
Dont make me lie with those two other women

Laban said No he would not make her lie
With anyone but that she had a mind to
If that was how she felt of course he said
She went her way But Laban having caught
This glimpse of lingering person in Eliza
And anxious to make all he could of it
With something he remembered in himself
Tried to think how he could exceed his promise
And give good measure to the dead though thankless
If that was how she felt he kept repeating
His first thought under pressure was a grave
In a new boughten grave plot by herself
Under he didnt care how great a stone
Hed sell a yoke of steers to pay for it
And werent there special cemetery flowers
That once grief sets to growing grief may rest
The flowers will go on with grief awhile
And no one seem neglecting or neglected
A prudent grief will not despise such aids
He thought of evergreen and everlasting
And then he had a thought worth many of these
Somewhere must be the grave of the young boy
Who married her for playmate more than helpmate
And sometimes laughed at what it was between them
How would she like to sleep her last with him
Where was his grave Did Laban know his name

He found the grave a town or two away
The headstone cut with John Beloved Husband
Beside it room reserved the say a sisters
A nevermarried sisters of that husband
Whether Eliza would be welcome there
The dead was bound to silence ask the sister
So Laban saw the sister and saying nothing
Of where Eliza wanted not to lie
And who had thought to lay her with her first love
Begged simply for the grave The sisters face
Fell all in wrinkles of responsibility
She wanted to do right Shed have to think
Laban was old and poor yet seemed to care
And she was old and poorbut she cared too
They sat She cast one dull old look at him
Then turned him out to go on other errands
She said he might attend to in the village
While she made up her mind how much she cared
And how much Laban caredand why he cared
She made shrewd eyes to see where he came in

Shed looked Eliza up her second time
A widow at her second husbands grave
And offered her a home to rest awhile
Before she went the poor mans widows way
Housekeeping for the next man out of wedlock
She and Eliza had been friends through all
Who was she to judge marriage in a world
Whose Bibles so confused up in marriage counsel
The sister had not come across this Laban
A decent product of lifes ironingout
She must not keep him waiting Time would press
Between the death day and the funeral day
So when she saw him coming in the street
She hurried her decision to be ready
To meet him with his answer at the door
Laban had known about what it would be
From the way she had set her poor old mouth
To do as she had put it what was right

She gave it through the screen door closed between them
No not with John There wouldnt be no sense
Elizas had too many other men

Laban was forced to fall back on his plan
To buy Eliza a plot to lie alone in
Which gives him for himself a choice of lots
When his time comes to die and settle down
A plow they say to plow the snow
They cannot mean to plant it no
Unless in bitterness to mock
At having cultivated rock
The witch that came the withered hag
To wash the steps with pail and rag
Was once the beauty Abishag
The picture pride of Hollywood
Too many fall from great and good
For you to doubt the likelihood
Die early and avoid the fate
Or if predestined to die late
Make up your mind to die in state
Make the whole stock exchange your own
If need be occupy a throne
Where nobody can call you crone
Some have relied on what they knew
Others on being simply true
What worked for them might work for you
No memory of having starred
Atones for later disregard
Or keeps the end from being hard
Better to go down dignified
With boughten friendship at your side
Than none at all Provide provide
You come to fetch me from my work tonight
When suppers on the table and well see
If I can leave off burying the white
Soft petals fallen from the apple tree
Soft petals yes but not so barren quite
Mingled with these smooth bean and wrinkled pea
And go along with you ere you lose sight
Of what you came for and become like me
Slave to a Springtime passion for the earth
How Love burns through the Putting in the Seed
On through the watching for that early birth
When just as the soil tarnishes with weed
The sturdy seedling with arched body comes
Shouldering its way and shedding the earth crumbs
Never have I been glad or sad
That there was such a thing as bad
There had to be I understood
For there to have been any good
It was by having been contrasted
That good and bad so long had lasted
Thats why discrimination reigns
Thats why we need a lot of brains
If only to discriminate
Twixt what to love and what to hate
To quote the oracle at Delphi
Love thy neighbor as thyself aye
And hate him as thyself thou hatest
There quandary is at its greatest
We learned from the forbidden fruit
For brains there is no substitute
Unless its sweetbreads  you suggest
With innuendo I detest
You drive me to confess in ink
Once I was fool enough to think
That brains and sweetbreads were the same
Till I was caught and put to shame
First by a butcher then a cook
Then by a scientific book
But  twas by making sweetbreads do
I passed with such a high IQ
The battle rent a cobweb diamondstrung
And cut a flower beside a ground birds nest
Before it stained a single human breast
The stricken flower bent double and so hung
And still the bird revisited her young
A butterfly its fall had dispossessed
A moment sought in air his flower of rest
Then lightly stooped to it and fluttering clung
On the bare upland pasture there had spread
Oernight twixt mullein stalks a wheel of thread
And straining cables wet with silver dew
A sudden passing bullet shook it dry
The indwelling spider ran to greet the fly
But finding nothing sullenly withdrew
Out through the fields and the woods
And over the walls I have wended
I have climbed the hills of view
And looked at the world and descended
I have come by the highway home
And lo it is ended

The leaves are all dead on the ground
Save those that the oak is keeping
To ravel them one by one
And let them go scraping and creeping
Out over the crusted snow
When others are sleeping

And the dead leaves lie huddled and still
No longer blown hither and thither
The last lone aster is gone
The flowers of the witch hazel wither
The heart is still aching to seek
But the feet question ‘Whither ’

Ah when to the heart of man
Was it ever less than a treason
To go with the drift of things
To yield with a grace to reason
And bow and accept the end
Of a love or a season
We make ourselves a place apart
Behind light words that tease and flout
But oh the agitated heart
Till someone find us really out
Tis pity if the case require
Or so we say that in the end
We speak the literal to inspire
The understanding of a friend
But so with all from babes that play
At hideandseek to God afar
So all who hide too well away
Must speak and tell us where they are
The surest thing there is is we are riders
And though none too successful at it guiders
Through everything presented land and tide
And now the very air of what we ride
What is this talkedof mystery of birth
But being mounted bareback on the earth
We can just see the infant up astride
His small fist buried in the bushy hide
There is our wildest mount a headless horse
But though it runs unbridled off its course
And all our blandishments would seem defied
We have ideas yet that we havent tried
A saturated meadow
Sunshaped and jewelsmall
A circle scarcely wider
Than the trees around were tall
Where winds were quite excluded
And the air was stifling sweet
With the breath of many flowers
A temple of the heat
There we bowed us in the burning
As the suns right worship is
To pick where none could miss them
A thousand orchises
For though the grass was scattered
yet every second spear
Seemed tipped with wings of color
That tinged the atmosphere
We raised a simple prayer
Before we left the spot
That in the general mowing
That place might be forgot
Or if not all so favored
Obtain such grace of hours
that none should mow the grass there
While so confused with flowers
Sea waves are green and wet
But up from where they die
Rise others vaster yet
And those are brown and dry
They are the sea made land
To come at the fisher town
And bury in solid sand
The men she could not drown
She may know cove and cape
But she does not know mankind
If by any change of shape
She hopes to cut off mind
Men left her a ship to sink
They can leave her a hut as well
And be but more free to think
For the one more castoff shell
When I spread out my hand here today
I catch no more than a ray
To feel of between thumb and fingers
No lasting effect of it lingers
There was one time and only the one
When dust really took in the sun
And from that one intake of fire
All creatures still warmly suspire
And if men have watched a long time
And never seen sunsmitten slime
Again come to life and crawl off
We not be too ready to scoff
God once declared he was true
And then took the veil and withdrew
And remember how final a hush
Then descended of old on the bush
God once spoke to people by name
The sun once imparted its flame
One impulse persists as our breath
The other persists as our faith
The three stood listening to a fresh access
Of wind that caught against the house a moment
Gulped snow and then blew free againthe Coles
Dressed but dishevelled from some hours of sleep
Meserve belittled in the great skin coat he wore
Meserve was first to speak He pointed backward
Over his shoulder with his pipestem saying
You can just see it glancing off the roof
Making a great scroll upward toward the sky
Long enough for recording all our names on
I think Ill just call up my wife and tell her
Im hereso farand starting on again
Ill call her softly so that if shes wise
And gone to sleep she neednt wake to answer
Three times he barely stirred the bell then listened
Why Lett still up Lett Im at Coles Im late
I called you up to say Goodnight from here
Before I went to say Goodmorning there
I thought I would I know but LettI know
I could but whats the sense The rest wont be
So bad Give me an hour for it Ho ho
Three hours to here But that was all up hill
The rest is down Why no no not a wallow
They kept their heads and took their time to it
Like darlings both of them Theyre in the barn
My dear Im coming just the same I didnt
Call you to ask you to invite me home
He lingered for some word she wouldnt say
Said it at last himself Goodnight and then
Getting no answer closed the telephone
The three stood in the lamplight round the table
With lowered eyes a moment till he said
Ill just see how the horses are
Yes do
Both the Coles said together Mrs Cole
Added You can judge better after seeing
I want you here with me Fred Leave him here
Brother Meserve You know to find your way
Out through the shed
I guess I know my way
I guess I know where I can find my name
Carved in the shed to tell me who I am
If it dont tell me where I am I used
To play
You tend your horses and come back
Fred Cole youre going to let him
Well arent you
How can you help yourself
I called him Brother
Why did I call him that
Its right enough
Thats all you ever heard him called round here
He seems to have lost off his Christian name
Christian enough I should call that myself
He took no notice did he Well at least
I didnt use it out of love of him
The dear knows I detest the thought of him
With his ten children under ten years old
I hate his wretched little Racker Sect
Alls ever I heard of it which isnt much
But thats not sayingLook Fred Cole its twelve
Isnt it now Hes been here half an hour
He says he left the village store at nine
Three hours to do four milesa mile an hour
Or not much better Why it doesnt seem
As if a man could move that slow and move
Try to think what he did with all that time
And three miles more to go
Dont let him go
Stick to him Helen Make him answer you
That sort of man talks straight on all his life
From the last thing he said himself stone deaf
To anything anyone else may say
I should have thought though you could make him hear you
What is he doing out a night like this
Why cant he stay at home
He had to preach
Its no night to be out
He may be small
He may be good but one things sure hes tough
And strong of stale tobacco
Hell pull through
You only say so Not another house
Or shelter to put into from this place
To theirs Im going to call his wife again
Wait and he may Lets see what he will do
Lets see if he will think of her again
But then I doubt hes thinking of himself
He doesnt look on it as anything
He shant gothere
It is a night my dear
One thing he didnt drag God into it
He dont consider it a case for God
You think so do you You dont know the kind
Hes getting up a miracle this minute
Privatelyto himself right now hes thinking
Hell make a case of it if he succeeds
But keep still if he fails
Keep still all over
Hell be deaddead and buried
Such a trouble
Not but Ive every reason not to care
What happens to him if it only takes
Some of the sanctimonious conceit
Out of one of those pious scalawags
Nonsense to that You want to see him safe
You like the runt
Dont you a little
Well
I dont like what hes doing which is what
You like and like him for
Oh yes you do
You like your fun as well as anyone
Only you women have to put these airs on
To impress men Youve got us so ashamed
Of being men we cant look at a good fight
Between two boys and not feel bound to stop it
Let the man freeze an ear or two I say
Hes here I leave him all to you Go in
And save his life All right come in Meserve
Sit down sit down How did you find the horses
Fine fine
And ready for some more My wife here
Says it wont do Youve got to give it up
Wont you to please me Please If I say please
Mr Meserve Ill leave it to your wife
What did your wife say on the telephone
Meserve seemed to heed nothing but the lamp
Or something not far from it on the table
By straightening out and lifting a forefinger
He pointed with his hand from where it lay
Like a white crumpled spider on his knee
That leaf there in your open book It moved
Just then I thought Its stood erect like that
There on the table ever since I came
Trying to turn itself backward or forward
Ive had my eye on it to make out which
If forward then its with a friends impatience
You see I knowto get you on to things
It wants to see how you will take if backward
Its from regret for something you have passed
And failed to see the good of Never mind
Things must expect to come in front of us
A many timesI dont say just how many
That varies with the thingsbefore we see them
One of the lies would make it out that nothing
Ever presents itself before us twice
Where would we be at last if that were so
Our very life depends on everythings
Recurring till we answer from within
The thousandth time may prove the charm That leaf
It cant turn either way It needs the winds help
But the wind didnt move it if it moved
It moved itself The winds at naught in here
It couldnt stir so sensitively poised
A thing as that It couldnt reach the lamp
To get a puff of black smoke from the flame
Or blow a rumple in the collies coat
You make a little foursquare block of air
Quiet and light and warm in spite of all
The illimitable dark and cold and storm
And by so doing give these three lamp dog
And bookleaf that keep near you their repose
Though for all anyone can tell repose
May be the thing you havent yet you give it
So false it is that what we havent we cant give
So false that what we always say is true
Ill have to turn the leaf if no one else will
It wont lie down Then let it stand Who cares
I shouldnt want to hurry you Meserve
But if youre going Say youll stay you know
But let me raise this curtain on a scene
And show you how its piling up against you
You see the snowwhite through the white of frost
Ask Helen how far up the sash its climbed
Since last we read the gage
It looks as if
Some pallid thing had squashed its features flat
And its eyes shut with overeagerness
To see what people found so interesting
In one another and had gone to sleep
Of its own stupid lack of understanding
Or broken its white neck of mushroom stuff
Short off and died against the windowpane
Brother Meserve take care youll scare yourself
More than you will us with such nightmare talk
Its you it matters to because its you
Who have to go out into it alone
Let him talk Helen and perhaps hell stay
Before you drop the curtainIm reminded
You recollect the boy who came out here
To breathe the air one winterhad a room
Down at the Averys Well one sunny morning
After a downy storm he passed our place
And found me banking up the house with snow
And I was burrowing in deep for warmth
Piling it well above the windowsills
The snow against the window caught his eye
Hey thats a pretty thoughtthose were his words
So you can think its six feet deep outside
While you sit warm and read up balanced rations
You cant get too much winter in the winter
Those were his words And he went home and all
But banked the daylight out of Averys windows
Now you and I would go to no such length
At the same time you cant deny it makes
It not a mite worse sitting here we three
Playing our fancy to have the snowline run
So high across the pane outside There where
There is a sort of tunnel in the frost
More like a tunnel than a holeway down
At the far end of it you see a stir
And quiver like the frayed edge of the drift
Blown in the wind I like thatI like that
Well now I leave you people
Come Meserve
We thought you were deciding not to go
The ways you found to say the praise of comfort
And being where you are You want to stay
Ill own its cold for such a fall of snow
This house is frozen brittle all except
This room you sit in If you think the wind
Sounds further off its not because its dying
Youre further under in the snowthats all
And feel it less Hear the soft bombs of dust
It bursts against us at the chimney mouth
And at the eaves I like it from inside
More than I shall out in it But the horses
Are rested and its time to say goodnight
And let you get to bed again Goodnight
Sorry I had to break in on your sleep
Lucky for you you did Lucky for you
You had us for a halfway station
To stop at If you were the kind of man
Paid heed to women youd take my advice
And for your familys sake stay where you are
But what good is my saying it over and over
Youve done more than you had a right to think
You could donow You know the risk you take
In going on
Our snowstorms as a rule
Arent looked on as mankillers and although
Id rather be the beast that sleeps the sleep
Under it all his door sealed up and lost
Than the man fighting it to keep above it
Yet think of the small birds at roost and not
In nests Shall I be counted less than they are
Their bulk in water would be frozen rock
In no time out tonight And yet tomorrow
They will come budding boughs from tree to tree
Flirting their wings and saying Chickadee
As if not knowing what you meant by the word storm
But why when no one wants you to go on
Your wifeshe doesnt want you to We dont
And you yourself dont want to Who else is there
Save us from being cornered by a woman
Well theresShe told Fred afterward that in
The pause right there she thought the dreaded word
Was coming God But no he only said
Well theresthe storm That says I must go on
That wants me as a war might if it came
Ask any man
He threw her that as something
To last her till he got outside the door
He had Cole with him to the barn to see him off
When Cole returned he found his wife still standing
Beside the table near the open book
Not reading it
Well what kind of a man
Do you call that she said
He had the gift
Of words or is it tongues I ought to say
Was ever such a man for seeing likeness
Or disregarding peoples civil questions
What Weve found out in one hour more about him
Than we had seeing him pass by in the road
A thousand times If thats the way he preaches
You didnt think youd keep him after all
Oh Im not blaming you He didnt leave you
Much say in the matter and Im just as glad
Were not in for a night of him No sleep
If he had stayed The least thing set him going
Its quiet as an empty church without him
But how much better off are we as it is
Well have to sit here till we know hes safe
Yes I suppose youll want to but I shouldnt
He knows what he can do or he wouldnt try
Get into bed I say and get some rest
He wont come back and if he telephones
It wont be for an hour or two
Well then
We cant be any help by sitting here
And living his fight through with him I suppose

Cole had been telephoning in the dark
Mrs Coles voice came from an inner room
Did she call you or you call her
She me
Youd better dress you wont go back to bed
We must have been asleep its three and after
Had she been ringing long Ill get my wrapper
I want to speak to her
All she said was
He hadnt come and had he really started
She knew he had poor thing two hours ago
He had the shovel Hell have made a fight
Why did I ever let him leave this house
Dont begin that You did the best you could
To keep himthough perhaps you didnt quite
Conceal a wish to see him show the spunk
To disobey you Much his wifell thank you
Fred after all I said You shant make out
That it was any way but what it was
Did she let on by any word she said
She didnt thank me
When I told her Gone
Well then she said and Well thenlike a threat
And then her voice came scraping slow Oh you
Why did you let him go
Asked why we let him
You let me there Ill ask her why she let him
She didnt dare to speak when he was here
Their numberstwentyone The thing wont work
Someones receivers down The handle stumbles
The stubborn thing the way it jars your arm
Its theirs Shes dropped it from her hand and gone
Try speaking Say Hello
Hello Hello
What do you hear
I hear an empty room
You knowit sounds that way And yes I hear
I think I hear a clockand windows rattling
No step though If shes there shes sitting down
Shout she may hear you
Shouting is no good
Keep speaking then
Hello Hello Hello
You dont suppose She wouldnt go out doors
Im half afraid thats just what she might do
And leave the children
Wait and call again
You cant hear whether she has left the door
Wide open and the winds blown out the lamp
And the fires died and the rooms dark and cold
One of two things either shes gone to bed
Or gone out doors
In which case both are lost
Do you know what shes like Have you ever met her
Its strange she doesnt want to speak to us
Fred see if you can hear what I hear Come
A clock maybe
Dont you hear something else
Not talking
No
Why yes I hearwhat is it
What do you say it is
A babys crying
Frantic it sounds though muffled and far off
Its mother wouldnt let it cry like that
Not if shes there
What do you make of it
Theres only one thing possible to make
That is assumingthat she has gone out
Of course she hasnt though They both sat down
Helpless Theres nothing we can do till morning
Fred I shant let you think of going out
Hold on The double bell began to chirp
They started up Fred took the telephone
Hello Meserve Youre there thenAnd your wife
Good Why I askedshe didnt seem to answer
He says she went to let him in the barn
Were glad Oh say no more about it man
Drop in and see us when youre passing
Well
She has him then though what she wants him for
I dont see
Possibly not for herself
Maybe she only wants him for the children
The whole todo seems to have been for nothing
What spoiled our night was to him just his fun
What did he come in forTo talk and visit
Thought hed just call to tell us it was snowing
If he thinks he is going to make our house
A halfway coffee house twixt town and nowhere 
I thought youd feel youd been too much concerned
You think you havent been concerned yourself
If you mean he was inconsiderate
To rout us out to think for him at midnight
And then take our advice no more than nothing
Why I agree with you But lets forgive him
Weve had a share in one night of his life
Whatll you bet he ever calls again
Two fairies it was
On a still summer day
Came forth in the woods
With the flowers to play
The flowers they plucked
They cast on the ground
For others and those
For still others they found
Flowerguided it was
That they came as they ran
On something that lay
In the shape of a man
The snow must have made
The feathery bed
When this one fell
On the sleep of the dead
But the snow was gone
A long time ago
And the body he wore
Nigh gone with the snow
The fairies drew near
And keenly espied
A ring on his hand
And a chain at his side
They knelt in the leaves
And eerily played
With the glittering things
And were not afraid
And when they went home
To hide in their burrow
They took them along
To play with tomorrow
When you came on death
Did you not come flowerguided
Like the elves in the wood
I remember that I did
But I recognised death
With sorrow and dread
And I hated and hate
The spoils of the dead
These pools that though in forests still reflect
The total sky almost without defect
And like the flowers beside them chill and shiver
Will like the flowers beside them soon be gone
And yet not out by any brook or river
But up by roots to bring dark foliage on
The trees that have it in their pentup buds
To darken nature and be summer woods
Let them think twice before they use their powers
To blot out and drink up and sweep away
These flowery waters and these watery flowers
From snow that melted only yesterday
How countlessly they congregate
Oer our tumultuous snow
Which flows in shapes as tall as trees
When wintry winds do blow
As if with keenness for our fate
Our faltering few steps on
To white rest and a place of rest
Invisible at dawn
And yet with neither love nor hate
Those stars like some snowwhite
Minervas snowwhite marble eyes
Without the gift of sight
Whose woods these are I think I know
His house is in the village though
He will not see me stopping here
To watch his woods fill up with snow
My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near
Between the woods and frozen lake
The darkest evening of the year
He gives his harness bells a shake
To ask if there is some mistake
The only other sounds the sweep
Of easy wind and downy flake
The woods are lovely dark and deep
But I have promises to keep
And miles to go before I sleep
And miles to go before I sleep
When the wind works against us in the dark
And pelts with snow
The lowest chamber window on the east
And whispers with a sort of stifled bark
The beast
Come out Come out
It costs no inward struggle not to go
Ah no
I count our strength
Two and a child
Those of us not asleep subdued to mark
How the cold creeps as the fire dies at length
How drifts are piled
Dooryard and road ungraded
Till even the comforting barn grows far away
And my heart owns a doubt
Whether tis in us to arise with day
And save ourselves unaided
Before man to blow to right
The wind once blew itself untaught
And did its loudest day and night
In any rough place where it caught
Man came to tell it what was wrong
It hadnt found the place to blow
It blew too hard the aim was song
And listen how it ought to go
He took a little in his mouth
And held it long enough for north
To be converted into south
And then by measure blew it forth
By measure It was word and note
The wind the wind had meant to be
A little through the lips and throat
The aim was song the wind could see
For every parcel I stoop down to seize
I lose some other off my arms and knees
And the whole pile is slipping bottles buns
Extremes too hard to comprehend at once
Yet nothing I should care to leave behind
With all I have to hold with hand and mind
And heart if need be I will do my best
To keep their building balanced at my breast
I crouch down to prevent them as they fall
Then sit down in the middle of them all
I had to drop the armful in the road
And try to stack them in a better load
Ive known ere now an interfering branch
Of alder catch my lifted axe behind me
But that was in the woods to hold my hand
From striking at another alders roots
And that was as I say an alder branch
This was a man Baptiste who stole one day
Behind me on the snow in my own yard
Where I was working at the chopping block
And cutting nothing not cut down already
He caught my axe expertly on the rise
When all my strength put forth was in his favor
Held it a moment where it was to calm me
Then took it from me and I let him take it
I didnt know him well enough to know
What it was all about There might be something
He had in mind to say to a bad neighbour
He might prefer to say to him disarmed
But all he had to tell me in FrenchEnglish
Was what he thought of not me but my axe
Me only as I took my axe to heart
It was the bad axehelve some one had sold me
Made on machine he said ploughing the grain
With a thick thumbnail to show how it ran
Across the handles long drawn serpentine
Like the two strokes across a dollar sign
You give her one good crack shes snap raght off
Den wheres your haxead flying trough de hair
Admitted and yet what was that to him
Come on my house and I put you one in
Whats las awhile good hickry whats grow crooked
De second growt I cut myselftough tough
Something to sell That wasnt how it sounded
Den when you say you come Its cost you nothing
Tonaght
As well tonight as any night
Beyond an overwarmth of kitchen stove
My welcome differed from no other welcome
Baptiste knew best why I was where I was
So long as he would leave enough unsaid
I shouldnt mind his being overjoyed
If overjoyed he was at having got me
Where I must judge if what he knew about an axe
That not everybody else knew was to count
For nothing in the measure of a neighbour
Hard if though cast away for life with Yankees
A Frenchman couldnt get his human rating
Mrs Baptiste came in and rocked a chair
That had as many motions as the world
One back and forward in and out of shadow
That got her nowhere one more gradual
Sideways that would have run her on the stove
In time had she not realized her danger
And caught herself up bodily chair and all
And set herself back where she started from
She aint spick too much Henglish dats too bad
I was afraid in brightening first on me
Then on Baptiste as if she understood
What passed between us she was only reigning
Baptiste was anxious for her but no more
Than for himself so placed he couldnt hope
To keep his bargain of the morning with me
In time to keep me from suspecting him
Of really never having meant to keep it
Needlessly soon he had his axehelves out
A quiverful to choose from since he wished me
To have the best he had or had to spare
Not for me to ask which when what he took
Had beauties he had to point me out at length
To ensure their not being wasted on me
He liked to have it slender as a whipstock
Free from the least knot equal to the strain
Of bending like a sword across the knee
He showed me that the lines of a good helve
Were native to the grain before the knife
Expressed them and its curves were no false curves
Put on it from without And there its strength lay
For the hard work He chafed its long white body
From end to end with his rough hand shut round it
He tried it at the eyehold in the axehead
Hahn hahn he mused dont need much taking down
Baptiste knew how to make a short job long
For love of it and yet not waste time either
Do you know what we talked about was knowledge
Baptiste on his defence about the children
He kept from school or did his best to keep
Whatever school and children and our doubts
Of laidon education had to do
With the curves of his axehelves and his having
Used these unscrupulously to bring me
To see for once the inside of his house
Was I desired in friendship partly as some one
To leave it to whether the right to hold
Such doubts of education should depend
Upon the education of those who held them
But now he brushed the shavings from his knee
And stood the axe there on its horses hoof
Erect but not without its waves as when
The snake stood up for evil in the Garden
Topheavy with a heaviness his short
Thick hand made light of steelblue chin drawn down
And in a little a French touch in that
Baptiste drew back and squinted at it pleased
See how shes cock her head
The bear puts both arms around the tree above her
And draws it down as if it were a lover
And its chokecherries lips to kiss goodby
Then lets it snap back upright in the sky
Her next step rocks a boulder on the wall
Shes making her crosscountry in the fall
Her great weight creaks the barbed wire in its staples
As she flings over and off down through the maples
Leaving on one wire tooth a lock of hair
Such is the uncaged progress of the bear
The world has room to make a bear feel free
The universe seems cramped to you and me
Man acts more like the poor bear in a cage
That all day fights a nervous inward rage
His mood rejecting all his mind suggests
He paces back and forth and never rests
The menail click and shuffle of his feet
The telescope at one end of his beat
And at the other end the microscope
Two instruments of nearly equal hope
And in conjunction giving quite a spread
Or if he rests from scientific tread
Tis only to sit back and sway his head
Through ninetyodd degrees of arc it seems
Between two metaphysical extremes
He sits back on his fundamental butt
With lifted snout and eyes if any shut
He almost looks religious but hes not
And back and forth he sways from cheek to cheek
At one extreme agreeing with one Greek
At the other agreeing with another Greek
Which may be thought but only so to speak
A baggy figure equally pathetic
When sedentary and when peripatetic
Here further up the mountain slope
Than there was every any hope
My father built enclosed a spring
Strung chains of wall round everything
Subdued the growth of earth to grass
And brought our various lives to pass
A dozen girls and boys we were
The mountain seemed to like the stir
And made of us a little while
With always something in her smile
Today she wouldnt know our name
No girls of course has stayed the same
The mountain pushed us off her knees
And now her lap is full of trees
We chanced in passing by that afternoon
To catch it in a sort of special picture
Among tarbanded ancient cherry trees
Set well back from the road in rank lodged grass
The little cottage we were speaking of
A front with just a door between two windows
Fresh painted by the shower a velvet black
We paused the minister and I to look
He made as if to hold it at arms length
Or put the leaves aside that framed it in
Pretty he said Come in No one will care
The path was a vague parting in the grass
That led us to a weathered windowsill
We pressed our faces to the pane You see he said
Everythings as she left it when she died
Her sons wont sell the house or the things in it
They say they mean to come and summer here
Where they were boys They havent come this year
They live so far awayone is out west
It will be hard for them to keep their word
Anyway they wont have the place disturbed
A buttoned haircloth lounge spread scrolling arms
Under a crayon portrait on the wall
Done sadly from an old daguerreotype
That was the father as he went to war
She always when she talked about war
Sooner or later came and leaned half knelt
Against the lounge beside it though I doubt
If such unlifelike lines kept power to stir
Anything in her after all the years
He fell at Gettysburg or Fredericksburg
I ought to knowit makes a difference which
Fredericksburg wasnt Gettysburg of course
But what Im getting to is how forsaken
A little cottage this has always seemed
Since she went more than ever but before
I dont mean altogether by the lives
That had gone out of it the father first
Then the two sons till she was left alone
Nothing could draw her after those two sons
She valued the considerate neglect
She had at some cost taught them after years
I mean by the worlds having passed it by
As we almost got by this afternoon
It always seems to me a sort of mark
To measure how far fifty years have brought us
Why not sit down if you are in no haste
These doorsteps seldom have a visitor
The warping boards pull out their own old nails
With none to tread and put them in their place
She had her own idea of things the old lady
And she liked talk She had seen Garrison
And Whittier and had her story of them
One wasnt long in learning that she thought
Whatever else the Civil War was for
It wasnt just to keep the States together
Nor just to free the slaves though it did both
She wouldnt have believed those ends enough
To have given outright for them all she gave
Her giving somehow touched the principle
That all men are created free and equal
And to hear her quaint phrasesso removed
From the worlds view today of all those things
Thats a hard mystery of Jeffersons
What did he mean Of course the easy way
Is to decide it simply isnt true
It may not be I heard a fellow say so
But never mind the Welshman got it planted
Where it will trouble us a thousand years
Each age will have to reconsider it
You couldnt tell her what the West was saying
And what the South to her serene belief
She had some art of hearing and yet not
Hearing the latter wisdom of the world
White was the only race she ever knew
Black she had scarcely seen and yellow never
But how could they be made so very unlike
By the same hand working in the same stuff
She had supposed the war decided that
What are you going to do with such a person
Strange how such innocence gets its own way
I shouldnt be surprised if in this world
It were the force that would at last prevail
Do you know but for her there was a time
When to please younger members of the church
Or rather say nonmembers in the church
Whom we all have to think of nowadays
I would have changed the Creed a very little
Not that she ever had to ask me not to
It never got so far as that but the bare thought
Of her old tremulous bonnet in the pew
And of her half asleep was too much for me
Why I might wake her up and startle her
It was the words descended into Hades
That seemed too pagan to our liberal youth
You know they suffered from a general onslaught
And well if they werent true why keep right on
Saying them like the heathen We could drop them
Onlythere was the bonnet in the pew
Such a phrase couldnt have meant much to her
But suppose she had missed it from the Creed
As a child misses the unsaid Goodnight
And falls asleep with heartachehow should I feel
Im just as glad she made me keep hands off
For dear me why abandon a belief
Merely because it ceases to be true
Cling to it long enough and not a doubt
It will turn true again for so it goes
Most of the change we think we see in life
Is due to truths being in and out of favour
As I sit here and oftentimes I wish
I could be monarch of a desert land
I could devote and dedicate forever
To the truths we keep coming back and back to
So desert it would have to be so walled
By mountain ranges half in summer snow
No one would covet it or think it worth
The pains of conquering to force change on
Scattered oases where men dwelt but mostly
Sand dunes held loosely in tamarisk
Blown over and over themselves in idleness
Sand grains should sugar in the natal dew
The babe born to the desert the sand storm
Retard midwaste my cowering caravans
There are bees in this wall He struck the clapboards
Fierce heads looked out small bodies pivoted
We rose to go Sunset blazed on the windows
OH let’s go up the hill and scare ourselves
As reckless as the best of them tonight
By setting fire to all the brush we piled
With pitchy hands to wait for rain or snow
Oh let’s not wait for rain to make it safe
The pile is ours we dragged it bough on bough
Down dark converging paths between the pines
Let’s not care what we do with it tonight
Divide it No But burn it as one pile
The way we piled it And let’s be the talk
Of people brought to windows by a light
Thrown from somewhere against their wallpaper
Rouse them all both the free and not so free
With saying what they’d like to do to us
For what they’d better wait till we have done
Let’s all but bring to life this old volcano
If that is what the mountain ever was
And scare ourselves Let wild fire loose we will…”
“And scare you too” the children said together
“Why wouldn’t it scare me to have a fire
Begin in smudge with ropy smoke and know
That still if I repent I may recall it
But in a moment not a little spurt
Of burning fatness and then nothing but
The fire itself can put it out and that
By burning out and before it burns out
It will have roared first and mixed sparks with stars
And sweeping round it with a flaming sword
Made the dim trees stand back in wider circle
Done so much and I know not how much more
I mean it shall not do if I can bind it
Well if it doesn’t with its draft bring on
A wind to blow in earnest from some quarter
As once it did with me upon an April
The breezes were so spent with winter blowing
They seemed to fail the bluebirds under them
Short of the perch their languid flight was toward
And my flame made a pinnacle to heaven
As I walked once round it in possession
But the wind out of doorsyou know the saying
There came a gust You used to think the trees
Made wind by fanning since you never knew
It blow but that you saw the trees in motion
Something or someone watching made that gust
It put the flame tipdown and dabbed the grass
Of overwinter with the least tiptouch
Your tongue gives salt or sugar in your hand
The place it reached to blackened instantly
The black was all there was by daylight
That and the merest curl of cigarette smoke
And a flame slender as the hepaticas
Bloodroot and violets so soon to be now
But the black spread like black death on the ground
And I think the sky darkened with a cloud
Like winter and evening coming on together
There were enough things to be thought of then
Where the field stretches toward the north
And setting sun to Hyla brook I gave it
To flames without twice thinking where it verges
Upon the road to flames too though in fear
They might find fuel there in withered brake
Grass its full length old silver goldenrod
And alder and grape vine entanglement
To leap the dusty deadline For my own
I took what front there was beside I knelt
And thrust hands in and held my face away
Fight such a fire by rubbing not by beating
A board is the best weapon if you have it
I had my coat And oh I knew I knew
And said out loud I couldn’t bide the smother
And heat so close in but the thought of all
The woods and town on fire by me and all
The town turned out to fight for methat held me
I trusted the brook barrier but feared
The road would fail and on that side the fire
Died not without a noise of crackling wood
Of something more than tindergrass and weed
That brought me to my feet to hold it back
By leaning back myself as if the reins
Were round my neck and I was at the plough
I won But I’m sure no one ever spread
Another color over a tenth the space
That I spread coalblack over in the time
It took me Neighbors coming home from town
Couldn’t believe that so much black had come there
While they had backs turned that it hadn’t been there
When they had passed an hour or so before
Going the other way and they not seen it
They looked about for someone to have done it
But there was no one I was somewhere wondering
Where all my weariness had gone and why
I walked so light on air in heavy shoes
In spite of a scorched FourthofJuly feeling
Why wouldn’t I be scared remembering that”
“If it scares you what will it do to us”
“Scare you But if you shrink from being scared
What would you say to war if it should come
That’s what for reasons I should like to know
If you can comfort me by any answer”
“Oh but war’s not for childrenit’s for men”
“Now we are digging almost down to China
My dears my dears you thought thatwe all thought it
So your mistake was ours Haven’t you heard though
About the ships where war has found them out
At sea about the towns where war has come
Through opening clouds at night with droning speed
Further o’erhead than all but stars and angels
And children in the ships and in the towns
Haven’t you heard what we have lived to learn
Nothing so newsomething we had forgotten
War is for everyone for children too
I wasn’t going to tell you and I mustn’t
The best way is to come up hill with me
And have our fire and laugh and be afraid”
There were three in the meadow by the brook
Gathering up windrows piling haycocks up
With an eye always lifted toward the west
Where an irregular sunbordered cloud
Darkly advanced with a perpetual dagger
Flickering across its bosom Suddenly
One helper thrusting pitchfork in the ground
Marched himself off the field and home One stayed
The townbred farmer failed to understand
What was there wrong
Something you said just now
What did I say
About our taking pains
To cock the haybecause its going to shower
I said that nearly half an hour ago
I said it to myself as much as you
You didnt know But James is one big fool
He thought you meant to find fault with his work
Thats what the average farmer would have meant
James had to take his time to chew it over
Before he acted hes just got round to act
He is a fool if thats the way he takes me
Dont let it bother you Youve found out something
The hand that knows his business wont be told
To do work faster or betterthose two things
Im as particular as anyone
Most likely Id have served you just the same
But I know you dont understand our ways
You were just talking what was in your mind
What was in all our minds and you werent hinting
Tell you a story of what happened once
I was up here in Salem at a mans
Named Sanders with a gang of four or five
Doing the haying No one liked the boss
He was one of the kind sports call a spider
All wiry arms and legs that spread out wavy
From a humped body nigh as big as a biscuit
But workthat man could work especially
If by so doing he could get more work
Out of his hired help Im not denying
He was hard on himself I couldnt find
That he kept any hoursnot for himself
Daylight and lanternlight were one to him
Ive heard him pounding in the barn all night
But what he liked was someone to encourage
Them that he couldnt lead hed get behind
And drive the way you can you know in mowing
Keep at their heels and threaten to mow their legs off
Id seen about enough of his bulling tricks
We call that bulling Id been watching him
So when he paired off with me in the hayfield
To load the load thinks I look out for trouble
I built the load and topped it off old Sanders
Combed it down with the rake and said O K
Everything went right till we reached the barn
With a big take to empty in a bay
You understand that meant the easy job
For the man up on top of throwing down
The hay and rolling it off wholesale
Where on a mow it would have been slow lifting
You wouldnt think a fellow d need much urging
Under those circumstances would you now
But the old fool seizes his fork in both hands
And looking up bewhiskered out of the pit
Shouts like an army captain Let her come
Thinks I dye mean it What was that you said
I asked out loud sos thered be no mistake
Did you say let her come Yes let her come
He said it over but he said it softer
Never you say a thing like that to a man
Not if he values what he is God Id as soon
Murdered him as left out his middle name
Id built the load and knew just where to find it
Two or three forkfuls I picked lightly round for
Like meditating and then I just dug in
And dumped the rackful on him in ten lots
I looked over the side once in the dust
And caught sight of him treadingwaterlike
Keeping his head above Damn ye I says
That gets ye He squeaked like a squeezed rat
That was the last I saw or heard of him
I cleaned the rack and drove out to cool off
As I sat mopping the hayseed from my neck
And sort of waiting to be asked about it
One of the boys sings out Wheres the old man
I left him in the barnunder the hay
If you want him you can go and dig him out
They realized from the way I swobbed my neck
More than was needed something must be up
They headed for the barn I stayed where I was
They told me afterward First they forked hay
A lot of it out into the barn floor
Nothing They listened for him Not a rustle
I guess they thought Id spiked him in the temple
Before I buried him else I couldnt have managed
They excavated more Go keep his wife
Out of the barn
Some one looked in a window
And curse me if he wasnt in the kitchen
Slumped way down in a chair with both his feet
Stuck in the oven the hottest day that summer
He looked so mad in back and so disgusted
There was no one that dared to stir him up
Or let him know that he was being looked at
Apparently I hadnt buried him
I may have knocked him down but just my trying
To bury him had hurt his dignity
He had gone to the house sos not to face me
He kept away from us all afternoon
We tended to his hay We saw him out
After a while picking peas in the garden
He couldnt keep away from doing something
Werent you relieved to find he wasnt dead
Noand yet I cant say its hard to tell
I went about to kill him fair enough
You took an awkward way Did he discharge you
Discharge me No He knew I did just right
Something inspires the only cow of late
To make no more of a wall than an open gate
And think no more of wallbuilders than fools
Her face is flecked with pomace and she drools
A cider syrup Having tasted fruit
She scorns a pasture withering to the root
She runs from tree to tree where lie and sweeten
The windfalls spiked with stubble and wormeaten
She leaves them bitten when she has to fly
She bellows on a knoll against the sky
Her udder shrivels and the milk goes dry
Mary sat musing on the lampflame at the table
Waiting for Warren When she heard his step
She ran on tiptoe down the darkened passage
To meet him in the doorway with the news
And put him on his guard Silas is back
She pushed him outward with her through the door
And shut it after her Be kind she said
She took the market things from Warrens arms
And set them on the porch then drew him down
To sit beside her on the wooden steps
When was I ever anything but kind to him
But Ill not have the fellow back he said
I told him so last haying didnt I
If he left then I said that ended it
What good is he Who else will harbour him
At his age for the little he can do
What help he is theres no depending on
Off he goes always when I need him most
He thinks he ought to earn a little pay
Enough at least to buy tobacco with
So he wont have to beg and be beholden
All right I say I cant afford to pay
Any fixed wages though I wish I could
Someone else can Then someone else will have to
I shouldnt mind his bettering himself
If that was what it was You can be certain
When he begins like that theres someone at him
Trying to coax him off with pocketmoney
In haying time when any help is scarce
In winter he comes back to us Im done
Sh not so loud hell hear you Mary said
I want him to hell have to soon or late
Hes worn out Hes asleep beside the stove
When I came up from Rowes I found him here
Huddled against the barndoor fast asleep
A miserable sight and frightening too
You neednt smileI didnt recognise him
I wasnt looking for himand hes changed
Wait till you see
Where did you say hed been
He didnt say I dragged him to the house
And gave him tea and tried to make him smoke
I tried to make him talk about his travels
Nothing would do he just kept nodding off
What did he say Did he say anything
But little
Anything Mary confess
He said hed come to ditch the meadow for me
Warren
 But did he I just want to know
Of course he did What would you have him say
Surely you wouldnt grudge the poor old man
Some humble way to save his selfrespect
He added if you really care to know
He meant to clear the upper pasture too
That sounds like something you have heard before
Warren I wish you could have heard the way
He jumbled everything I stopped to look
Two or three timeshe made me feel so queer
To see if he was talking in his sleep
He ran on Harold Wilsonyou remember
The boy you had in haying four years since
Hes finished school and teaching in his college
Silas declares youll have to get him back
He says they two will make a team for work
Between them they will lay this farm as smooth
The way he mixed that in with other things
He thinks young Wilson a likely lad though daft
On educationyou know how they fought
All through July under the blazing sun
Silas up on the cart to build the load
Harold along beside to pitch it on
Yes I took care to keep well out of earshot
Well those days trouble Silas like a dream
You wouldnt think they would How some things linger
Harolds young college boys assurance piqued him
After so many years he still keeps finding
Good arguments he sees he might have used
I sympathise I know just how it feels
To think of the right thing to say too late
Harolds associated in his mind with Latin
He asked me what I thought of Harolds saying
He studied Latin like the violin
Because he liked itthat an argument
He said he couldnt make the boy believe
He could find water with a hazel prong
Which showed how much good school had ever done him
He wanted to go over that But most of all
He thinks if he could have another chance
To teach him how to build a load of hay
I know thats Silas one accomplishment
He bundles every forkful in its place
And tags and numbers it for future reference
So he can find and easily dislodge it
In the unloading Silas does that well
He takes it out in bunches like big birds nests
You never see him standing on the hay
Hes trying to lift straining to lift himself
He thinks if he could teach him that hed be
Some good perhaps to someone in the world
He hates to see a boy the fool of books
Poor Silas so concerned for other folk
And nothing to look backward to with pride
And nothing to look forward to with hope
So now and never any different
Part of a moon was falling down the west
Dragging the whole sky with it to the hills
Its light poured softly in her lap She saw
And spread her apron to it She put out her hand
Among the harplike morningglory strings
Taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves
As if she played unheard the tenderness
That wrought on him beside her in the night
Warren she said he has come home to die
You neednt be afraid hell leave you this time
Home he mocked gently
Yes what else but home
It all depends on what you mean by home
Of course hes nothing to us any more
Than was the hound that came a stranger to us
Out of the woods worn out upon the trail
Home is the place where when you have to go there
They have to take you in
I should have called it
Something you somehow havent to deserve
Warren leaned out and took a step or two
Picked up a little stick and brought it back
And broke it in his hand and tossed it by
Silas has better claim on us you think
Than on his brother Thirteen little miles
As the road winds would bring him to his door
Silas has walked that far no doubt today
Why didnt he go there His brothers rich
A somebodydirector in the bank
He never told us that
We know it though
I think his brother ought to help of course
Ill see to that if there is need He ought of right
To take him in and might be willing to
He may be better than appearances
But have some pity on Silas Do you think
If hed had any pride in claiming kin
Or anything he looked for from his brother
Hed keep so still about him all this time
I wonder whats between them
I can tell you
Silas is what he iswe wouldnt mind him
But just the kind that kinsfolk cant abide
He never did a thing so very bad
He dont know why he isnt quite as good
As anyone He wont be made ashamed
To please his brother worthless though he is
I cant think Si ever hurt anyone
No but he hurt my heart the way he lay
And rolled his old head on that sharpedged chairback
He wouldnt let me put him on the lounge
You must go in and see what you can do
I made the bed up for him there tonight
Youll be surprised at himhow much hes broken
His working days are done Im sure of it
Id not be in a hurry to say that
I havent been Go look see for yourself
But Warren please remember how it is
Hes come to help you ditch the meadow
He has a plan You mustnt laugh at him
He may not speak of it and then he may
Ill sit and see if that small sailing cloud
Will hit or miss the moon
It hit the moon
Then there were three there making a dim row
The moon the little silver cloud and she
Warren returnedtoo soon it seemed to her
Slipped to her side caught up her hand and waited
Warren she questioned
Dead was all he answered
It was far in the sameness of the wood
I was running with joy on the Demon’s trail
Though I knew what I hunted was no true god
It was just as the light was beginning to fail
That I suddenly heardall I needed to hear
It has lasted me many and many a year
The sound was behind me instead of before
A sleepy sound but mocking half
As of one who utterly couldn’t care
The Demon arose from his wallow to laugh
Brushing the dirt from his eye as he went
And well I knew what the Demon meant
I shall not forget how his laugh rang out
I felt as a fool to have been so caught
And checked my steps to make pretence
It was something among the leaves I sought
Though doubtful whether he stayed to see
Thereafter I sat me against a tree
In going from room to room in the dark
I reached out blindly to save my face
But neglected however lightly to lace
My fingers and close my arms in an arc
A slim door got in past my guard
And hit me a blow in the head so hard
I had my native simile jarred
So people and things dont pair any more
With what they used to pair with before
He gave the solid rail a hateful kick
From far away there came an answering tick
And then another tick He knew the code
His hate had roused an engine up the road
He wished when he had had the track alone
He had attacked it with a club or stone
And bent some rail wide open like switch
So as to wreck the engine in the ditch
Too late though now he had himself to thank
Its click was rising to a nearer clank
Here it came breasting like a horse in skirts
He stood well back for fear of scalding squirts
Then for a moment all there was was size
Confusion and a roar that drowned the cries
He raised against the gods in the machine
Then once again the sandbank lay serene
The travelers eye picked up a turtle train
between the dotted feet a streak of tail
And followed it to where he made out vague
But certain signs of buried turtles egg
And probing with one finger not too rough
He found suspicious sand and sure enough
The pocket of a little turtle mine
If there was one egg in it there were nine
Torpedolike with shell of gritty leather
All packed in sand to wait the trump together
Youd better not disturb any more
He told the distance I am armed for war
The next machine that has the power to pass
Will get this plasm in it goggle glass
You were forever finding some new play
So when I saw you down on hands and knees
I the meadow busy with the newcut hay
Trying I thought to set it up on end
I went to show you how to make it stay
If that was your idea against the breeze
And if you asked me even help pretend
To make it root again and grow afresh
But twas no makebelieve with you today
Nor was the grass itself your real concern
Though I found your hand full of wilted fern
Steelbright Junegrass and blackening heads of clovers
Twas a nest full of young birds on the ground
The cutterbar had just gone champing over
Miraculously without tasking flesh
And left defenseless to the heat and light
You wanted to restore them to their right
Of something interposed between their sight
And too much world at oncecould means be found
The way the nestfull every time we stirred
Stood up to us as to a motherbird
Whose coming home has been too long deferred
Made me ask would the motherbird return
And care for them in such a change of scene
And might out meddling make her more afraid
That was a thing we could not wait to learn
We saw the risk we took in doing good
But dared not spare to do the best we could
Though harm should come of it so built the screen
You had begun and gave them back their shade
All this to prove we cared Why is there then
No more to tell We turned to other things
I havent any memoryhave you
Of ever coming to the place again
To see if the birds lived the first night through
And so at last to learn to use their wings
A lantern light from deeper in the barn
Shone on a man and woman in the door
And threw their lurching shadows on a house
Near by all dark in every glossy window
A horses hoof pawed once the hollow floor
And the back of the gig they stood beside
Moved in a little The man grasped a wheel
The woman spoke out sharply Whoa stand still
I saw it just as plain as a white plate
She said as the light on the dashboard ran
Along the bushes at the roadsidea mans face
You must have seen it too
I didnt see it
Are you sure
Yes Im sure
it was a face
Joel Ill have to look I cant go in
I cant and leave a thing like that unsettled
Doors locked and curtains drawn will make no difference
I always have felt strange when we came home
To the dark house after so long an absence
And the key rattled loudly into place
Seemed to warn someone to be getting out
At one door as we entered at another
What if Im right and someone all the time
Dont hold my arm
I say its someone passing
You speak as if this were a travelled road
You forget where we are What is beyond
That hed be going to or coming from
At such an hour of night and on foot too
What was he standing still for in the bushes
Its not so very lateits only dark
Theres more in it than youre inclined to say
Did he look like
He looked like anyone
Ill never rest tonight unless I know
Give me the lantern
You dont want the lantern
She pushed past him and got it for herself
Youre not to come she said This is my business
If the times come to face it Im the one
To put it the right way Hed never dare
Listen He kicked a stone Hear that hear that
Hes coming towards us Joel go inplease
HarkI dont hear him now But please go in
In the first place you cant make me believe its
It isor someone else hes sent to watch
And nows the time to have it out with him
While we know definitely where he is
Let him get off and hell be everywhere
Around us looking out of trees and bushes
Till I shant dare to set a foot outdoors
And I cant stand it Joel let me go
But its nonsense to think hed care enough
You mean you couldnt understand his caring
Oh but you see he hadnt had enough
Joel I wontI wontI promise you
We mustnt say hard things You mustnt either
Ill be the one if anybody goes
But you give him the advantage with this light
What couldnt he do to us standing here
And if to see was what he wanted why
He has seen all there was to see and gone
He appeared to forget to keep his hold
But advanced with her as she crossed the grass
What do you want she cried to all the dark
She stretched up tall to overlook the light
That hung in both hands hot against her skirt
Theres no one so youre wrong he said
There is
What do you want she cried and then herself
Was startled when an answer really came
Nothing It came from well along the road
She reached a hand to Joel for support
The smell of scorching woollen made her faint
What are you doing round this house at night
Nothing A pause there seemed no more to say
And then the voice again You seem afraid
I saw by the way you whipped up the horse
Ill just come forward in the lantern light
And let you see
Yes doJoel go back
She stood her ground against the noisy steps
That came on but her body rocked a little
You see the voice said
Oh She looked and looked
You dont seeIve a child here by the hand
Whats a child doing at this time of night
Out walking Every child should have the memory
Of at least one longafterbedtime walk
What son
Then I should think youd try to find
Somewhere to walk
The highway as it happens
Were stopping for the fortnight down at Deans
But if thats allJoelyou realize
You wont think anything You understand
You understand that we have to be careful
This is a very very lonely place
Joel She spoke as if she couldnt turn
The swinging lantern lengthened to the ground
It touched it struck it clattered and went out
Blood has been harder to dam back than water
Just when we think we have it impounded safe
Behind new barrier walls and let it chafe
It breaks away in some new kind of slaughter
We choose to say it is let loose by the devil
But power of blood itself releases blood
It goes by might of being such a flood
Held high at so unnatural a level
It will have outlet brave and not so brave
weapons of war and implements of peace
Are but the points at which it finds release
And now it is once more the tidal wave
That when it has swept by leaves summits stained
Oh blood will out It cannot be contained
The fishermans swapping a yarn for a yarn
Under the hand of the village barber
And her in the angle of house and barn
His deepsea dory has found a harbor
At anchor she rides the sunny sod
As full to the gunnel of flowers growing
As ever she turned her home with cod
From Georges bank when winds were blowing
And I judge from that elysian freight
That all they ask is rougher weather
And dory and master will sail by fate
To seek the Happy Isles together
Ive tried the new moon tilted in the air
Above a hazy treeandfarmhouse cluster
As you might try a jewel in your hair
Ive tried it fine with little breadth of luster
Alone or in one ornament combining
With one firstwater start almost shining
I put it shining anywhere I please
By walking slowly on some evening later
Ive pulled it from a crate of crooked trees
And brought it over glossy water greater
And dropped it in and seen the image wallow
The color run all sorts of wonder follow
A governor it was proclaimed this time
When all who would come seeking in New Hampshire
Ancestral memories might come together
And those of the name Stark gathered in Bow
A rockstrewn town where farming has fallen off
And sproutlands flourish where the axe has gone
Someone had literally run to earth
In an old cellar hole in a byroad
The origin of all the family there
Thence they were sprung so numerous a tribe
That now not all the houses left in town
Made shift to shelter them without the help
Of here and there a tent in grove and orchard
They were at Bow but that was not enough
Nothing would do but they must fix a day
To stand together on the craters verge
That turned them on the world and try to fathom
The past and get some strangeness out of it
But rain spoiled all The day began uncertain
With clouds low trailing and moments of rain that misted
The young folk held some hope out to each other
Till well toward noon when the storm settled down
With a swish in the grass What if the others
Are there they said It isnt going to rain
Only one from a farm not far away
Strolled thither not expecting he would find
Anyone else but out of idleness
One and one other yes for there were two
The second round the curving hillside road
Was a girl and she halted some way off
To reconnoitre and then made up her mind
At least to pass by and see who he was
And perhaps hear some word about the weather
This was some Stark she didnt know He nodded
No fête today he said
It looks that way
She swept the heavens turning on her heel
I only idled down
I idled down
Provision there had been for just such meeting
Of stranger cousins in a family tree
Drawn on a sort of passport with the branch
Of the one bearing it done in detail
Some zealous ones laborious device
She made a sudden movement toward her bodice
As one who clasps her heart They laughed together
Stark he inquired No matter for the proof
Yes Stark And you
Im Stark He drew his passport
You know we might not be and still be cousins
The town is full of Chases Lowes and Baileys
All claiming some priority in Starkness
My mother was a Lane yet might have married
Anyone upon earth and still her children
Would have been Starks and doubtless here today
You riddle with your genealogy
Like a Viola I dont follow you
I only mean my mother was a Stark
Several times over and by marrying father
No more than brought us back into the name
One ought not to be thrown into confusion
By a plain statement of relationship
But I own what you say makes my head spin
You take my card you seem so good at such things
And see if you can reckon our cousinship
Why not take seats here on the cellar wall
And dangle feet among the raspberry vines
Under the shelter of the family tree
Just so that ought to be enough protection
Not from the rain I think its going to rain
Its raining
No its misting lets be fair
Does the rain seem to you to cool the eyes
The situation was like this the road
Bowed outward on the mountain halfway up
And disappeared and ended not far off
No one went home that way The only house
Beyond where they were was a shattered seedpod
And below roared a brook hidden in trees
The sound of which was silence for the place
This he sat listening to till she gave judgment
On fathers side it seems were let me see 
Dont be too technical You have three cards
Four cards one yours three mine one for each branch
Of the Stark family Im a member of
Dyou know a person so related to herself
Is supposed to be mad
I may be mad
You look so sitting out here in the rain
Studying genealogy with me
You never saw before What will we come to
With all this pride of ancestry we Yankees
I think were all mad Tell me why were here
Drawn into town about this cellar hole
Like wild geese on a lake before a storm
What do we see in such a hole I wonder
The Indians had a myth of Chicamoztoc
Which means The Seven Caves that We Came out of
This is the pit from which we Starks were digged
You must be learned Thats what you see in it
And what do you see
Yes what do I see
First let me look I see raspberry vines 
Oh if youre going to use your eyes just hear
What I see Its a little little boy
As pale and dim as a match flame in the sun
Hes groping in the cellar after jam
He thinks its dark and its flooded with daylight
Hes nothing Listen When I lean like this
I can make out old Grandsir Stark distinctly
With his pipe in his mouth and his brown jug
Bless you it isnt Grandsir Stark its Granny
But the pipes there and smoking and the jug
Shes after cider the old girl shes thirsty
Heres hoping she gets her drink and gets out safely
Tell me about her Does she look like me
She should shouldnt she youre so many times
Over descended from her I believe
She does look like you Stay the way you are
The nose is just the same and sos the chin
Making allowance making due allowance
You poor dear great great great great Granny
See that you get her greatness right Dont stint her
Yes its important though you think it isnt
I wont be teased But see how wet I am
Yes you must go we cant stay here for ever
But wait until I give you a hand up
A bead of silver water more or less
Strung on your hair wont hurt your summer looks
I wanted to try something with the noise
That the brook raises in the empty valley
We have seen visions now consult the voices
Something I must have learned riding in trains
When I was young I used the roar
To set the voices speaking out of it
Speaking or singing and the bandmusic playing
Perhaps you have the art of what I mean
Ive never listened in among the sounds
That a brook makes in such a wild descent
It ought to give a purer oracle
Its as you throw a picture on a screen
The meaning of it all is out of you
The voices give you what you wish to hear
Strangely its anything they wish to give
Then I dont know It must be strange enough
I wonder if its not your makebelieve
What do you think youre like to hear today
From the sense of our having been together
But why take time for what Im like to hear
Ill tell you what the voices really say
You will do very well right where you are
A little longer I mustnt feel too hurried
Or I cant give myself to hear the voices
Is this some trance you are withdrawing into
You must be very still you mustnt talk
Ill hardly breathe
The voices seem to say 
Im waiting
Dont The voices seem to say
Call her Nausicaa the unafraid
Of an acquaintance made adventurously
I let you say that on consideration
I dont see very well how you can help it
You want the truth I speak but by the voices
You see they know I havent had your name
Though what a name should matter between us 
I shall suspect 
Be good The voices say
Call her Nausicaa and take a timber
That you shall find lies in the cellar charred
Among the raspberries and hew and shape it
For a doorsill or other corner piece
In a new cottage on the ancient spot
The life is not yet all gone out of it
And come and make your summer dwelling here
And perhaps she will come still unafraid
And sit before you in the open door
With flowers in her lap until they fade
But not come in across the sacred sill 
I wonder where your oracle is tending
You can see that theres something wrong with it
Or it would speak in dialect Whose voice
Does it purport to speak in Not old Grandsirs
Nor Grannys surely Call up one of them
They have best right to be heard in this place
You seem so partial to our greatgrandmother
Nine times removed Correct me if I err
You will be likely to regard as sacred
Anything she may say But let me warn you
Folks in her day were given to plain speaking
You think youd best tempt her at such a time
It rests with us always to cut her off
Well then its Granny speaking I dunnow
Mebbe Im wrong to take it as I do
There aint no names quite like the old ones though
Nor never will be to my way of thinking
One mustnt bear too hard on the new comers
But theres a dite too many of them for comfort
I should feel easier if I could see
More of the salt wherewith theyre to be salted
Son you do as youre told You take the timber
Its as sound as the day when it was cut
And begin over  There shed better stop
You can see what is troubling Granny though
But dont you think we sometimes make too much
Of the old stock What counts is the ideals
And those will bear some keeping still about
I can see we are going to be good friends
I like your going to be You said just now
Its going to rain
I know and it was raining
I let you say all that But I must go now
You let me say it on consideration
How shall we say goodbye in such a case
How shall we
Will you leave the way to me
No I dont trust your eyes Youve said enough
Now give me your hand up Pick me that flower
Where shall we meet again
Nowhere but here
Once more before we meet elsewhere
In rain
It ought to be in rain Sometime in rain
In rain tomorrow shall we if it rains
But if we must in sunshine So she went
The land was ours before we were the lands
She was our land more than a hundred years
Before we were her people She was ours
In Massachusetts in Virginia
But we were Englands still colonials
Possessing what we still were unpossessed by
Possessed by what we now no more possessed
Something we were withholding made us weak
Until we found out that it was ourselves
We were withholding from our land of living
And forthwith found salvation in surrender
Such as we were we gave ourselves outright
The deed of gift was many deeds of war
To the land vaguely realizing westward
But still unstoried artless unenhanced
Such as she was such as she would become
There overtook me and drew me in
To his downhill earlymorning stride
And set me five miles on my road
Better than if he had had me ride
A man with a swinging bag forload
And half the bag wound round his hand
We talked like barking above the din
Of water we walked along beside
And for my telling him where Id been
And where I lived in mountain land
To be coming home the way I was
He told me a little about himself
He came from higher up in the pass
Where the grist of the newbeginning brooks
Is blocks split off the mountain mass
And hop eless grist enough it looks
Ever to grind to soil for grass
The way it is will do for moss
There he had built his stolen shack
It had to be a stolen shack
Because of the fears of fire and logs
That trouble the sleep of lumber folk
Visions of half the world burned black
And the sun shrunken yellow in smoke
We know who when they come to town
Bring berries under the wagon seat
Or a basket of eggs between their feet
What this man brought in a cotton sack
Was gum the gum of the mountain spruce
He showed me lumps of the scented stuff
Like uncut jewels dull and rough
It comes to market golden brown
But turns to pink between the teeth
I told him this is a pleasant life
To set your breast to the bark of trees
That all your days are dim beneath
And reaching up with a little knife
To loose the resin and take it down
And bring it to market when you please
It was too lonely for her there
And too wild
And since there were but two of them
And no child
And work was little in the house
She was free
And followed where he furrowed field
Or felled log
She rested on a log and tossed
The fresh chips
With a song only to herself
On her lips
And once she went to break a bough
Of black alder
She strayed so far she scarcely heard
When he called her
And didnt answer didnt speak
Or return
She stood and then she ran and hid
In the fern
He never found her though he looked
Everywhere
And he asked at her mothers house
Was she there
Sudden and swift and light as that
The ties gave
And he learned of finalities
Besides the grave
I let myself in at the kitchen door
Its you she said I cant get up Forgive me
Not answering your knock I can no more
Let people in than I can keep them out
Im getting too old for my size I tell them
My fingers are about all Ive the use of
Sos to take any comfort I can sew
I help out with this beadwork what I can
Thats a smart pair of pumps youre beading there
Who are they for
You mean oh for some miss
I cant keep track of other peoples daughters
Lord if I were to dream of everyone
Whose shoes I primped to dance in
And wheres John
Havent you seen him Strange what set you off
To come to his house when hes gone to yours
You cant have passed each other I know what
He must have changed his mind and gone to Garlands
He wont be long in that case You can wait
Though what good you can be or anyone
Its gone so far Youve heard Estelles run off
Yes whats it all about When did she go
Two weeks since
Shes in earnest it appears
Im sure she wont come back Shes hiding somewhere
I dont know where myself John thinks I do
He thinks I only have to say the word
And shell come back But bless you Im her mother
I cant talk to her and Lord if I could
It will go hard with John What will he do
He cant find anyone to take her place
Oh if you ask me that what will he do
He gets some sort of bakeshop meals together
With me to sit and tell him everything
Whats wanted and how much and where it is
But when Im gone of course I cant stay here
Estelles to take me when shes settled down
He and I only hinder one another
I tell them they cant get me through the door though
Ive been built in here like a big church organ
Weve been here fifteen years
Thats a long time
To live together and then pull apart
How do you see him living when youre gone
Two of you out will leave an empty house
I dont just see him living many years
Left here with nothing but the furniture
I hate to think of the old place when were gone
With the brook going by below the yard
And no one here but hens blowing about
If he could sell the place but then he cant
No one will ever live on it again
Its too run down This is the last of it
What I think he will do is let things smash
Hell sort of swear the time away Hes awful
I never saw a man let family troubles
Make so much difference in his mans affairs
Hes just dropped everything Hes like a child
I blame his being brought up by his mother
Hes got hay down thats been rained on three times
He hoed a little yesterday for me
I thought the growing things would do him good
Something went wrong I saw him throw the hoe
Skyhigh with both hands I can see it now
Come here Ill show you in that apple tree
Thats no way for a man to do at his age
Hes fiftyfive you know if hes a day
Arent you afraid of him Whats that gun for
Oh thats been there for hawks since chickentime
John Hall touch me Not if he knows his friends
Ill say that for him Johns no threatener
Like some men folk No ones afraid of him
All is hes made up his mind not to stand
What he has got to stand
Where is Estelle
Couldnt one talk to her What does she say
You say you dont know where she is
Nor want to
She thinks if it was bad to live with him
It must be right to leave him
Which is wrong
Yes but he should have married her
I know
The strains been too much for her all these years
I cant explain it any other way
Its different with a man at least with John
He knows hes kinder than the run of men
Better than married ought to be as good
As married thats what he has always said
I know the way hes felt but all the same
I wonder why he doesnt marry her
And end it
Too late now she wouldnt have him
Hes given her time to think of something else
Thats his mistake The dear knows my interest
Has been to keep the thing from breaking up
This is a good home I dont ask for better
But when Ive said Why shouldnt they be married
Hed say Why should they no more words than that
And after all why should they Johns been fair
I take it What was his was always hers
There was no quarrel about property
Reason enough there was no property
A friend or two as good as own the farm
Such as it is It isnt worth the mortgage
I mean Estelle has always held the purse
The rights of that are harder to get at
I guess Estelle and I have filled the purse
Twas we let him have money not he us
Johns a bad farmer Im not blaming him
Take it year in year out he doesnt make much
We came here for a home for me you know
Estelle to do the housework for the board
Of both of us But look how it turns out
She seems to have the housework and besides
Half of the outdoor work though as for that
Hed say she does it more because she likes it
You see our pretty things are all outdoors
Our hens and cows and pigs are always better
Than folks like us have any business with
Farmers around twice as well off as we
Havent as good They dont go with the farm
One thing you cant help liking about John
Hes fond of nice things too fond some would say
But Estelle dont complain shes like him there
She wants our hens to be the best there are
You never saw this room before a show
Full of lank shivery halfdrowned birds
In separate coops having their plumage done
The smell of the wet feathers in the heat
You spoke of Johns not being safe to stay with
You dont know what a gentle lot we are
We wouldnt hurt a hen You ought to see us
Moving a flock of hens from place to place
Were not allowed to take them upside down
All we can hold together by the legs
Two at a times the rule one on each arm
No matter how far and how many times
We have to go
You mean thats Johns idea
And we live up to it or I dont know
What childishness he wouldnt give way to
He manages to keep the upper hand
On his own farm Hes boss But as to hens
We fence our flowers in and the hens range
Nothings too good for them We say it pays
John likes to tell the offers he has had
Twenty for this cock twentyfive for that
He never takes the money If theyre worth
That much to sell theyre worth as much to keep
Bless you its all expense though Reach me down
The little tin box on the cupboard shelf
The upper shelf the tin box Thats the one
Ill show you Here you are
Whats this
A bill
For fifty dollars for one Langshang cock
Receipted And the cock is in the yard
Not in a glass case then
Hed need a tall one
He can eat off a barrel from the ground
Hes been in a glass case as you may say
The Crystal Palace London Hes imported
John bought him and we paid the bill with beads
Wampum I call it Mind we dont complain
But you see dont you we take care of him
And like it too It makes it all the worse
It seems as if And thats not all hes helpless
In ways that I can hardly tell you of
Sometimes he gets possessed to keep accounts
To see where all the money goes so fast
You know how men will be ridiculous
But its just fun the way he gets bedeviled
If hes untidy now what will he be
It makes it all the worse You must be blind
Estelles the one You neednt talk to me
Cant you and I get to the root of it
Whats the real trouble What will satisfy her
Its as I say shes turned from him thats all
But why when shes well off Is it the neighbours
Being cut off from friends
We have our friends
That isnt it Folks arent afraid of us
Shes let it worry her You stood the strain
And youre her mother
But I didnt always
I didnt relish it along at first
But I got wonted to it And besides
John said I was too old to have grandchildren
But whats the use of talking when its done
She wont come back its worse than that she cant
Why do you speak like that What do you know
What do you mean shes done harm to herself
I mean shes married married someone else
Oho oho
You dont believe me
Yes I do
Only too well I knew there must be something
So that was what was back Shes bad thats all
Bad to get married when she had the chance
Nonsense See whats she done But who who 
Whod marry her straight out of such a mess
Say it right out no matter for her mother
The man was found Id better name no names
John himself wont imagine who he is
Then its all up I think Ill get away
Youll be expecting John I pity Estelle
I suppose she deserves some pity too
You ought to have the kitchen to yourself
To break it to him You may have the job
You neednt think youre going to get away
Johns almost here Ive had my eye on someone
Coming down Ryans Hill I thought twas him
Here he is now This box Put it away
And this bill
Whats the hurry Hell unhitch
No he wont either Hell just drop the reins
And turn Doll out to pasture rig and all
She wont get far before the wheels hang up
On something theres no harm See there he is
My but he looks as if he must have heard
John threw the door wide but he didnt enter
How are you neighbour Just the man Im after
Isnt it Hell he said I want to know
Come out here if you want to hear me talk
Ill talk to you old woman afterward
Ive got some news that maybe isnt news
What are they trying to do to me these two
Do go along with him and stop his shouting
She raised her voice against the closing door
Who wants to hear your news you dreadful fool
It was too lonely for her there
And too wild
And since there were but two of them
And no child
And work was little in the house
She was free
And followed where he furrowed field
Or felled tree
She rested on a log and tossed
The fresh chips
With a song only to herself
On her lips
And once she went to break a bough
Of black alder
She strayed so far she scarcely heard
When he called her
And didnt answerdidnt speak
Or return
She stood and then she ran and hid
In the fern
He never found her though he looked
Everywhere
And he asked at her mothers house
Was she there
Sudden and swift and light as that
The ties gave
And he learned of finalities
Besides the grave
Over back where they speak of life as staying
You couldnt call it living for it aint
There was an old old house renewed with paint
And in it a piano loudly playing
Out in the plowed ground in the cold a digger
Among unearthed potatoes standing still
Was counting winter dinners one a hill
With half an ear to the pianos vigor
All that piano and new paint back there
Was it some money suddenly come into
Or some extravagance young love had been to
Or old love on an impulse not to care
Not to sink under being man and wife
But get some color and music out of life
Builder in building the little house
In every way you may please yourself
But please please me in the kitchen chimney
Dont build me a chimney upon a shelf
However far you must go for bricks
Whatever they cost apiece or a pound
But me enough for a fulllength chimney
And build the chimney clear from the ground
Its not that Im greatly afraid of fire
But I never heard of a house that throve
And I know of one that didnt thrive
Where the chimney started above the stove
And I dread the ominous stain of tar
That there always is on the papered walls
And the smell of fire drowned in rain
That there always is when the chimneys false
A shelfs for a clock or vase or picture
But I dont see why it should have to bear
A chimney that only would serve to remind me
Of castles I used to build in air
Theres a place called Faraway Meadow
We never shall mow in again
Or such is the talk at the farmhouse
The meadow is finished with men
Then now is the chance for the flowers
That cant stand mowers and plowers
It must be now through in season
Before the not mowing brings trees on
Before trees seeing the opening
March into a shadowy claim
The trees are all Im afraid of
That flowers cant bloom in the shade of
Its no more men Im afraid of
The meadow is done with the tame
The place for the moment is ours
For you oh tumultuous flowers
To go to waste and go wild in
All shapes and colors of flowers
I neednt call you by name
As told to a child
As I went out a Crow
In a low voice said Oh
I was looking for you
How do you do
I just came to tell you
To tell Lesley will you
That her little Bluebird
Wanted me to bring word
That the north wind last night
That made the stars bright
And made ice on the trough
Almost made him cough
His tail feathers off
He just had to fly
But he sent her Goodby
And said to be good
And wear her red hood
And look for the skunk tracks
In the snow with an ax
And do everything
And perhaps in the spring
He would come back and sing
Here come the linegang pioneering by
They throw a forest down less cut than broken
They plant dead trees for living and the dead
They string together with a living thread
They string an instrument against the sky
Wherein words whether beaten out or spoken
Will run as hushed as when they were a thought
But in no hush they string it they go past
With shouts afar to pull the cable taught
To hold it hard until they make it fast
To ease away they have it With a laugh
An oath of towns that set the wild at naught
They bring the telephone and telegraph
It went many years
But at last came a knock
And I thought of the door
With no lock to lock
I blew out the light
I tiptoed the floor
And raised both hands
In prayer to the door
But the knock came again
My window was wide
I climbed on the sill
And descended outside
Back over the sill
I bade a Come in
To whoever the knock
At the door may have been
So at a knock
I emptied my cage
To hide in the world
And alter with age
No speed of wind or water rushing by
But you have speed far greater You can climb
Back up a stream of radiance to the sky
And back through history up the stream of time
And you were given this swiftness not for haste
Nor chiefly that you may go where you will
But in the rush of everything to waste
That you may have the power of standing still
Off any still or moving thing you say
Two such as you with such a master speed
Cannot be parted nor be swept away
From one another once you are agreed
That life is only life forevermore
Together wing to wing and oar to oar
He thought he kept the universe alone
For all the voice in answer he could wake
Was but the mocking echo of his own
From some treehidden cliff across the lake
Some morning from the boulderbroken beach
He would cry out on life that what it wants
Is not its own love back in copy speech
But counterlove original response
And nothing ever came of what he cried
Unless it was the embodiment that crashed
In the cliffs talus on the other side
And then in the far distant water splashed
But after a time allowed for it to swim
Instead of proving human when it neared
And someone else additional to him
As a great buck it powerfully appeared
Pushing the crumpled water up ahead
And landed pouring like a waterfall
And stumbled through the rocks with horny tread
And forced the underbrushand that was all
The mountain held the town as in a shadow
I saw so much before I slept there once
I noticed that I missed stars in the west
Where its black body cut into the sky
Near me it seemed I felt it like a wall
Behind which I was sheltered from a wind
And yet between the town and it I found
When I walked forth at dawn to see new things
Were fields a river and beyond more fields
The river at the time was fallen away
And made a widespread brawl on cobblestones
But the signs showed what it had done in spring
Good grassland gullied out and in the grass
Ridges of sand and driftwood stripped of bark
I crossed the river and swung round the mountain
And there I met a man who moved so slow
With whitefaced oxen in a heavy cart
It seemed no hand to stop him altogether
What town is this I asked
This Lunenburg
Then I was wrong the town of my sojourn
Beyond the bridge was not that of the mountain
But only felt at night its shadowy presence
Where is your village Very far from here
There is no villageonly scattered farms
We were but sixty voters last election
We cant in nature grow to many more
That thing takes all the room He moved his goad
The mountain stood there to be pointed at
Pasture ran up the side a little way
And then there was a wall of trees with trunks
After that only tops of trees and cliffs
Imperfectly concealed among the leaves
A dry ravine emerged from under boughs
Into the pasture
That looks like a path
Is that the way to reach the top from here
Not for this morning but some other time
I must be getting back to breakfast now
I dont advise your trying from this side
There is no proper path but those that have
Been up I understand have climbed from Ladds
Thats five miles back You cant mistake the place
They logged it there last winter some way up
Id take you but Im bound the other way
Youve never climbed it
Ive been on the sides
Deerhunting and troutfishing Theres a brook
That starts up on it somewhereIve heard say
Right on the top tiptopa curious thing
But what would interest you about the brook
Its always cold in summer warm in winter
One of the great sights going is to see
It steam in winter like an oxs breath
Until the bushes all along its banks
Are inchdeep with the frosty spines and bristles
You know the kind Then let the sun shine on it
There ought to be a view around the world
From such a mountainif it isnt wooded
Clear to the top I saw through leafy screens
Great granite terraces in sun and shadow
Shelves one could rest a knee on getting up
With depths behind him sheer a hundred feet
Or turn and sit on and look out and down
With little ferns in crevices at his elbow
As to that I cant say But theres the spring
Right on the summit almost like a fountain
That ought to be worth seeing
If its there
You never saw it
I guess theres no doubt
About its being there I never saw it
It may not be right on the very top
It wouldnt have to be a long way down
To have some head of water from above
And a good distance down might not be noticed
By anyone whod come a long way up
One time I asked a fellow climbing it
To look and tell me later how it was
What did he say
He said there was a lake
Somewhere in Ireland on a mountain top
But a lakes different What about the spring
He never got up high enough to see
Thats why I dont advise your trying this side
He tried this side Ive always meant to go
And look myself but you know how it is
It doesnt seem so much to climb a mountain
Youve worked around the foot of all your life
What would I do Go in my overalls
With a big stick the same as when the cows
Havent come down to the bars at milking time
Or with a shotgun for a stray black bear
Twouldnt seem real to climb for climbing it
I shouldnt climb it if I didnt want to
Not for the sake of climbing Whats its name
We call it Hor I dont know if thats right
Can one walk around it Would it be too far
You can drive round and keep in Lunenburg
But its as much as ever you can do
The boundary lines keep in so close to it
Hor is the township and the townships Hor
And a few houses sprinkled round the foot
Like boulders broken off the upper cliff
Rolled out a little farther than the rest
Warm in December cold in June you say
I dont suppose the waters changed at all
You and I know enough to know its warm
Compared with cold and cold compared with warm
But all the funs in how you say a thing
Youve lived here all your life
Ever since Hor
Was no bigger than a What I did not hear
He drew the oxen toward him with light touches
Of his slim goad on nose and offside flank
Gave them their marching orders and was moving
The house had gone to bring again
To the midnight sky a sunset glow
Now the chimney was all of the house that stood
Like a pistil after the petals go
The barn opposed across the way
That would have joined the house in flame
Had it been the will of the wind was left
To bear forsaken the places name
No more it opened with all one end
For teams that came by the stony road
To drum on the floor with scurrying hoofs
And brush the mow with the summer load
The birds that came to it through the air
At broken windows flew out and in
Their murmur more like the sigh we sigh
From too much dwelling on what has been
Yet for them the lilac renewed its leaf
And the aged elm though touched with fire
And the dry pump flung up an awkward arm
And the fence post carried a strand of wire
For them there was really nothing sad
But though they rejoiced in the nest they kept
One had to be versed in country things
Not to believe the phoebes wept
At the end of the row
I stepped on the toe
Of an unemployed hoe
It rose in offense
And struck me a blow
In the seat of my sense
It wasnt to blame
But I called it a name
And I must say it dealt
Me a blow that I felt
Like a malice prepense
You may call me a fool
But was there a rule
The weapon should be
Turned into a tool
And what do we see
The first tool I step on
Turned into a weapon
She had no saying dark enough
For the dark pine that kept
Forever trying the window latch
Of the room where they slept
The tireless but ineffectual hands
That with every futile pass
Made the great tree seem as a little bird
Before the mystery of glass
It never had been inside the room
And only one of the two
Was afraid in an oftrepeated dream
Of what the tree might do
ALWAYS the same when on a fated night
At last the gathered snow lets down as white
As may be in dark woods and with a song
It shall not make again all winter long
Of hissing on the yet uncovered ground
I almost stumble looking up and round
As one who overtaken by the end
Gives up his errand and lets death descend
Upon him where he is with nothing done
To evil no important triumph won
More than if life had never been begun

Yet all the precedent is on my side
I know that winter death has never tried
The earth but it has failed the snow may heap
In long storms an undrifted four feet deep
As measured against maple birch and oak
It cannot check the peepers silver croak
And I shall see the snow all go down hill
In water of a slender April rill
That flashes tail through last years withered brake
And dead weeds like a disappearing snake
Nothing will be left white but here a birch
And there a clump of houses with a church
There is a singer eveyone has heard
Loud a midsummer and a midwood bird
Who makes the solid tree trunks sound again
He says that leaves are old and that for flowers
Midsummer is to spring as one to ten
He says the early petalfall is past
When pear and cherry bloom went down in showers
On sunny days a moment overcast
And comes that other fall we name the fall
He says the highway dust is over all
The bird would cease and be as other birds
But that he knows in singing not to sing
The question that he frames in all but words
Is what to make of a diminished thing
Im going out to clean the pasture spring
Ill only stop to rake the leaves away
And wait to watch the water clear I may
I shant be gone long You come too
Im going out to fetch the little calf
Thats standing by the mother Its so young
It totters when she licks it with her tongue
I shant be gone long You come too
NOW that theyve got it settled whose I be
Im going to tell them something they wont like
Theyve got it settled wrong and I can prove it
Flattered I must be to have two towns fighting
To make a present of me to each other
They dont dispose me either one of them
To spare them any trouble Double troubles
Always the witchs motto anyway
Ill double theirs for both of them you watch me
Theyll find theyve got the whole thing to do over
That is if facts is what they want to go by
They set a lot now dont they by a record
Of Arthur Amys having once been up
For Hog Reeve in March Meeting here in Warren
I could have told them any time this twelvemonth
The Arthur Amy I was married to
Couldnt have been the one they say was up
In Warren at March Meeting for the reason
He want but fifteen at the time they say
The Arthur Amy I was married to
voted the only times he ever voted
Which wasnt many in the town of Wentworth
One of the times was when twas in the warrant
To see if the town wanted to take over
The tote road to our clearing where we lived
Ill tell you whod remember Heman Lapish
Their Arthur Amy was the father of mine
So now theyve dragged it through the law courts once
I guess theyd better drag it through again
Wentworth and Warrens both good towns to live in
Only I happen to prefer to live
In Wentworth from now on and when alls said
Rights right and the temptation to do right
When I can hurt someone by doing it
Has always been too much for me it has
I know of some folks thatd be set up
At having in their town a noted witch
But most would have to think of the expense
That even I would be They ought to know
That as a witch Id often milk a bat
And thatd be enough to last for days
Itd make my position stronger I think
If I was to consent to give some sign
To make it surer that I was a witch
It want no sign I spose when Mallice Huse
Said that I took him out in his old age
And rode all over everything on him
Until Id had him worn to skin and bones
And if Id left him hitched unblanketed
In front of one Town Hall Id left him hitched
In front of every one in Grafton County
Some cried shame on me not to blanket him
The poor old man It would have been all right
If some one hadnt said to gnaw the posts
He stood beside and leave his trade mark on them
So they could recognize them Not a post
That they could hear tell of was scarified
They made him keep on gnawing till he whined
Then that same smarty someone said to look
Hed bet Huse was a cribber and had gnawed
The crib he slept in and as sures youre born
They found hed gnawed the four posts of his bed
All four of them to splinters What did that prove
Not that he hadnt gnawed the hitching posts
He said he had besides Because a horse
Gnaws in the stable aint no proof to me
He dont gnaw trees and posts and fences too
But everybody took it for proof
I was a strapping girl of twenty then
The smarty someone who spoiled everything
Was Arthur Amy You know who he was
That was the way he started courting me
He never said much after we were married
But I mistrusted he was none too proud
Of having interfered in the Huse business
I guess he found he got more out of me
By having me a witch Or something happened
To turn him round He got to saying things
To undo what hed done and make it right
Like No she aint come back from kiting yet
Last night was one of her nights out Shes kiting
She thinks when the wind makes a night of it
She might as well herself But he liked best
To let on he was plagued to death with me
If anyone had seen me coming home
Over the ridgepole stride of a broomstick
As often as he had in the tail of the night
He guessed theyd know what he had to put up with
Well I showed Arthur Amy signs enough
Off from the house as far as we could keep
And from barn smells you cant wash out of ploughed ground
With all the rain and snow of seven years
And I dont mean just skulls of Rogers Rangers
On Moosilauke but woman signs to man
Only bewitched so I would last him longer
Up where the trees grow short the mosses tall
I made him gather me wet snow berries
On slippery rocks beside a waterfall
I made him do it for me in the dark
And he liked everything I made him do
I hope if he is where he sees me now
Hes so far off he cant see what Ive come to
You can come down from everything to nothing
All is if Id aknown when I was young
And full of it that this would be the end
It doesnt seem as if Id had the courage
To make so free and kick up in folks faces
I might have but it doesnt seem as if
If heaven were to do again
And on the pasture bars
I leaned to line the figures in
Between the dotted stars
I should be tempted to forget
I fear the Crown of Rule
The Scales of Trade the Cross of Faith
As hardly worth renewal
For these have governed in our lives
And see how men have warred
The Cross the Crown the Scales may all
As well have been the Sword
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth
Then took the other as just as fair
And having perhaps the better claim
Because it was grassy and wanted wear
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black
Oh I kept the first for another day
Yet knowing how way leads on to way
I doubted if I should ever come back
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence
Two roads diverged in a wood and I
I took the one less traveled by
And that has made all the difference
The rose is a rose
And was always a rose
But the theory now goes
That the apples a rose
And the pear is and sos
The plum I suppose
The dear only knows
What will next prove a rose
You of course are a rose
But were always a rose
Once when the snow of the year was beginning to fall
We stopped by a mountain pasture to say Whose colt
A little Morgan had one forefoot on the wall
The other curled at his breast He dipped his head
And snorted at us And then he had to bolt
We heard the miniature thunder where he fled
And we saw him or thought we saw him dim and grey
Like a shadow against the curtain of falling flakes
I think the little fellows afraid of the snow
He isnt winterbroken It isnt play
With the little fellow at all Hes running away
I doubt if even his mother could tell him Sakes
Its only weather Hed think she didnt know
Where is his mother He cant be out alone
And now he comes again with a clatter of stone
And mounts the wall again with whited eyes
And all his tail that isnt hair up straight
He shudders his coat as if to throw off flies
Whoever it is that leaves him out so late
When other creatures have gone to stall and bin
Ought to be told to come and take him in
We dance round in a ring and suppose
But the Secret sits in the middle and knows
She is as in a field a silken tent
At midday when the sunny summer breeze
Has dried the dew and all its ropes relent
So that in guys it gently sways at ease
And its supporting central cedar pole
That is its pinnacle to heavenward
And signifies the sureness of the soul
Seems to owe naught to any single cord
But strictly held by none is loosely bound
By countless silken ties of love and thought
To every thing on earth the compass round
And only by ones going slightly taut
In the capriciousness of summer air
Is of the slightlest bondage made aware
He is that fallen lance that lies as hurled
That lies unlifted now come dew come rust
But still lies pointed as it ploughed the dust
If we who sight along it round the world
See nothing worthy to have been its mark
It is because like men we look too near
Forgetting that as fitted to the sphere
Our missiles always make too short an arc
They fall they rip the grass they intersect
The curve of earth and striking break their own
They make us cringe for metalpoint on stone
But this we know the obstacle that checked
And tripped the body shot the spirit on
Further than target ever showed or shone
I wonder about the trees
Why do we wish to bear
Forever the noise of these
More than another noise
So close to our dwelling place
We suffer them by the day
Till we lose all measure of pace
And fixity in our joys
And acquire a listening air
They are that that talks of going
But never gets away
And that talks no less for knowing
As it grows wiser and older
That now it means to stay
My feet tug at the floor
And my head sways to my shoulder
Sometimes when I watch trees sway
From the window or the door
I shall set forth for somewhere
I shall make the reckless choice
Some day when they are in voice
And tossing so as to scare
The white clouds over them on
I shall have less to say
But I shall be gone
The old dog barks backwards without getting up
I can remember when he was a pup
Anonymous submission
You know Orion always comes up sideways
Throwing a leg up over our fence of mountains
And rising on his hands he looks in on me
Busy outdoors by lanternlight with something
I should have done by daylight and indeed
After the ground is frozen I should have done
Before it froze and a gust flings a handful
Of waste leaves at my smoky lantern chimney
To make fun of my way of doing things
Or else fun of Orions having caught me
Has a man I should like to ask no rights
These forces are obliged to pay respect to
So Brad McLaughlin mingled reckless talk
Of heavenly stars with huggermugger farming
Till having failed at huggermugger farming
He burned his house down for the fire insurance
And spent the proceeds on a telescope
To satisfy a lifelong curiosity
About our place among the infinities
What do you want with one of those blame things
I asked him well beforehand Dont you get one
Dont call it blamed there isnt anything
More blameless in the sense of being less
A weapon in our human fight he said
Ill have one if I sell my farm to buy it
There where he moved the rocks to plow the ground
And plowed between the rocks he couldnt move
Few farms changed hands so rather than spend years
Trying to sell his farm and then not selling
He burned his house down for the fire insurance
And bought the telescope with what it came to
He had been heard to say by several
The best thing that were put here fors to see
The strongest thing thats given us to see withs
A telescope Someone in every town
Seems to me owes it to the town to keep one
In Littleton it might as well be me
After such loose talk it was no surprise
When he did what he did and burned his house down
Mean laughter went about the town that day
To let him know we werent the least imposed on
And he could waitwed see to him tomorrow
But the first thing next morning we reflected
If one by one we counted people out
For the least sin it wouldnt take us long
To get so we had no one left to live with
For to be social is to be forgiving
Our thief the one who does our stealing from us
We dont cut off from coming to church suppers
But what we miss we go to him and ask for
He promptly gives it back that is if still
Uneaten unworn out or undisposed of
It wouldnt do to be too hard on Brad
About his telescope Beyond the age
Of being given one for Christmas gift
He had to take the best way he knew how
To find himself in one Well all we said was
He took a strange thing to be roguish over
Some sympathy was wasted on the house
A good oldtimer dating back along
But a house isnt sentient the house
Didnt feel anything And if it did
Why not regard it as a sacrifice
And an oldfashioned sacrifice by fire
Instead of a newfashioned one at auction
Out of a house and so out of a farm
At one stroke of a match Brad had to turn
To earn a living on the Concord railroad
As underticketagent at a station
Where his job when he wasnt selling tickets
Was setting out up track and down not plants
As on a farm but planets evening stars
That varied in their hue from red to green
He got a good glass for six hundred dollars
His new job gave him leisure for stargazing
Often he bid me come and have a look
Up the brass barrel velvet black inside
At a star quaking in the other end
I recollect a night of broken clouds
And underfoot snow melted down to ice
And melting further in the wind to mud
Bradford and I had out the telescope
We spread our two legs as we spread its three
Pointed our thoughts the way we pointed it
And standing at our leisure till the day broke
Said some of the best things we ever said
That telescope was christened the StarSplitter
Because it didnt do a thing but split
A star in two or three the way you split
A globule of quicksilver in your hand
With one stroke of your finger in the middle
Its a starsplitter if there ever was one
And ought to do some good if splitting stars
Sa thing to be compared with splitting wood
Weve looked and looked but after all where are we
Do we know any better where we are
And how it stands between the night tonight
And a man with a smoky lantern chimney
How different from the way it ever stood
When I was just as far as I could walk From here today There was an hour All still When leaning with my head again a flower I heard you talk Dont say I didnt for I heard you say You spoke from that flower on the window sill Do you remember what it was you said First tell me what it was you thought you heard Having found the flower and driven a bee away I leaned on my head And holding by the stalk I listened and I thought I caught the word What was it Did you call me by my name Or did you say Someone said Come I heard it as I bowed I may have thought as much but not aloud Well so I came
More than halfway up the pass
Was a spring with a broken drinking glass
And whether the farmer drank or not
His mare was sure to observe the spot
By cramping the wheel on a waterbar
turning her forehead with a star
And straining her ribs for a monster sigh
To which the farmer would make reply
A sigh for every so many breath
And for every so many sigh a death
Thats what I always tell my wife
Is the multiplication table of life
The saying may be ever so true
But its just the kind of a thing that you
Nor I nor nobody else may say
Unless our purpose is doing harm
And then I know of no better way
To close a road abandon a farm
Reduce the births of the human race
And bring back nature in peoples place
EVEN the bravest that are slain
Shall not dissemble their surprise
On waking to find valor reign
Even as on earth in paradise
And where they sought without the sword
Wide fields of asphodel fore’er
To find that the utmost reward
Of daring should be still to dare

The light of heaven falls whole and white
And is not shattered into dyes
The light for ever is morning light
The hills are verdured pasturewise
The angel hosts with freshness go
And seek with laughter what to brave
And binding all is the hushed snow
Of the fardistant breaking wave

And from a clifftop is proclaimed
The gathering of the souls for birth
The trial by existence named
The obscuration upon earth
And the slant spirits trooping by
In streams and cross and counterstreams
Can but give ear to that sweet cry
For its suggestion of what dreams

And the more loitering are turned
To view once more the sacrifice
Of those who for some good discerned
Will gladly give up paradise
And a white shimmering concourse rolls
Toward the throne to witness there
The speeding of devoted souls
Which God makes his especial care

And none are taken but who will
Having first heard the life read out
That opens earthward good and ill
Beyond the shadow of a doubt
And very beautifully God limns
And tenderly life’s little dream
But naught extenuates or dims
Setting the thing that is supreme

Nor is there wanting in the press
Some spirit to stand simply forth
Heroic in its nakedness
Against the uttermost of earth
The tale of earth’s unhonored things
Sounds nobler there than ’neath the sun
And the mind whirls and the heart sings
And a shout greets the daring one

But always God speaks at the end
’One thought in agony of strife
The bravest would have by for friend
The memory that he chose the life
But the pure fate to which you go
Admits no memory of choice
Or the woe were not earthly woe
To which you give the assenting voice’

And so the choice must be again
But the last choice is still the same
And the awe passes wonder then
And a hush falls for all acclaim
And God has taken a flower of gold
And broken it and used therefrom
The mystic link to bind and hold
Spirit to matter till death come

‘Tis of the essence of life here
Though we choose greatly still to lack
The lasting memory at all clear
That life has for us on the wrack
Nothing but what we somehow chose
Thus are we wholly stripped of pride
In the pain that has but one close
Bearing it crushed and mystified
I went to turn the grass once after one
Who mowed it in the dew before the sun
The dew was gone that made his blade so keen
Before I came to view the levelled scene
I looked for him behind an isle of trees
I listened for his whetstone on the breeze
But he had gone his way the grass all mown
And I must be as he had beenalone
As all must be I said within my heart
Whether they work together or apart
But as I said it swift there passed me by
On noiseless wing a bewildered butterfly
Seeking with memories grown dim over night
Some resting flower of yesterdays delight
And once I marked his flight go round and round
As where some flower lay withering on the ground
And then he flew as far as eye could see
And then on tremulous wing came back to me
I thought of questions that have no reply
And would have turned to toss the grass to dry
But he turned first and led my eye to look
At a tall tuft of flowers beside a brook
A leaping tongue of bloom the scythe had spared
Beside a reedy brook the scythe had bared
I left my place to know them by their name
Finding them butterflyweed when I came
The mower in the dew had loved them thus
By leaving them to flourish not for us
Nor yet to draw one thought of ours to him
But from sheer morning gladness at the brim
The butterfly and I had lit upon
Nevertheless a message from the dawn
That made me hear the wakening birds around
And hear his long scythe whispering to the ground
And feel a spirit kindred to my own
So that henceforth I worked no more alone
But glad with him I worked as with his aid
And weary sought at noon with him the shade
And dreaming as it were held brotherly speech
With one whose thought I had not hoped to reach
Men work together I told him from the heart
Whether they work together or apart
He is said to have been the last Red man
In Action And the Miller is said to have laughed
If you like to call such a sound a laugh
But he gave no one else a laughers license
For he turned suddenly grave as if to say
Whose businessif I take it on myself
Whose businessbut why talk round the barn
When its just that I hold with getting a thing done with
You cant get back and see it as he saw it
Its too long a story to go into now
Youd have to have been there and lived it
They you wouldnt have looked on it as just a matter
Of who began it between the two races
Some guttural exclamation of surprise
The Red man gave in poking about the mill
Over the great big thumping shuffling millstone
Disgusted the Miller physically as coming
From one who had no right to be heard from
Come John he said you want to see the wheelpint
He took him down below a cramping rafter
And showed him through a manhole in the floor
The water in desperate straits like frantic fish
Salmon and sturgeon lashing with their tails
The he shut down the trap door with a ring in it
That jangled even above the general noise
And came upstairs aloneand gave that laugh
And said something to a man with a mealsack
That the man with the mealsack didnt catchthen
Oh yes he showed John the wheelpit all right
If tires of trees I seek again mankind Well I know where to hie mein the dawn To a slope where the cattle keep the lawn There amid loggin juniper reclined Myself unseen I see in white defined Far off the homes of men and farther still The graves of men on an opposing hill Living or dead whichever are to mind And if by noon I have too much of these I have but to turn on my arm and lo The sunburned hillside sets my face aglow My breathing shakes the bluet like a breeze I smell the earth I smell the bruisèd plant I look into the crater of the ant
I staid the night for shelter at a farm
Behind the mountains with a mother and son
Two oldbelievers They did all the talking
MOTHER Folks think a witch who has familiar spirits
She could call up to pass a winter evening
But wont should be burned at the stake or something
Summoning spirits isnt Button button
Whos got the button I would have them know
SON Mother can make a common table rear
And kick with two legs like an army mule
MOTHER And when Ive done it what good have I
done
Rather than tip a table for you let me
Tell you what Ralle the Sioux Control once told me
He said the dead had souls but when I asked him
How could that be I thought the dead were souls
He broke my trance Dont that make you suspicious
That theres something the dead are keeping back
Yes theres something the dead are keeping back
SON You wouldnt want to tell him what we have
Up attic mother
MOTHER Bones a skeleton
SON But the headboard of mothers bed is pushed
Against the attic door the door is nailed
Its harmless Mother hears it in the night
Halting perplexed behind the barrier
Of door and headboard Where it wants to get
Is back into the cellar where it came from
MOTHER Well never let them will we son Well
never
SON It left the cellar forty years ago
And carried itself like a pile of dishes
Up one flight from the cellar to the kitchen
Another from the kitchen to the bedroom
Another from the bedroom to the attic
Right past both father and mother and neither stopped
it
Father had gone upstairs mother was downstairs
I was a baby I dont know where I was
MOTHER The only fault my husband found with me
I went to sleep before I went to bed
Especially in winter when the bed
Might just as well be ice and the clothes snow
The night the bones came up the cellarstairs
Toffile had gone to bed alone and left me
But left an open door to cool the room off
So as to sort of turn me out of it
I was just coming to myself enough
To wonder where the cold was coming from
When I heard Toffile upstairs in the bedroom
And thought I heard him downstairs in the cellar
The board we had laid down to walk dryshod on
When there was water in the cellar in spring
Struck the hard cellar bottom And then someone
Began the stairs two footsteps for each step
The way a man with one leg and a crutch
Or a little child comes up It wasnt Toffile
It wasnt anyone who could be there
The bulkhead doubledoors were doublelocked
And swollen tight and buried under snow
The cellar windows were banked up with sawdust
And swollen tight and buried under snow
It was the bones I knew them and good reason
My first impulse was to get to the knob
And hold the door But the bones didnt try
The door they halted helpless on the landing
Waiting for things to happen in their favour
The faintest restless rustling ran all through them
I never could have done the thing I did
If the wish hadnt been too strong in me
To see how they were mounted for this walk
I had a vision of them put together
Not like a man but like a chandelier
So suddenly I flung the door wide on him
A moment he stood balancing with emotion
And all but lost himself A tongue of fire
Flashed out and licked along his upper teeth
Smoke rolled inside the sockets of his eyes
Then he came at me with one hand outstretched
The way he did in life once but this time
I struck the hand off brittle on the floor
And fell back from him on the floor myself
The fingerpieces slid in all directions
Where did I see one of those pieces lately
Hand me my buttonbox it must be there
I sat up on the floor and shouted Toffile
Its coming up to you It had its choice
Of the door to the cellar or the hall
It took the hall door for the novelty
And set off briskly for so slow a thing
Stillgoing every which way in the joints though
So that it looked like lightning or a scribble
From the slap I had just now given its hand
I listened till it almost climbed the stairs
From the hall to the only finished bedroom
Before I got up to do anything
Then ran and shouted Shut the bedroom door
Toffile for my sake Company he said
Dont make me get up Im too warm in bed
So lying forward weakly on the handrail
I pushed myself upstairs and in the light
The kitchen had been dark I had to own
I could see nothing Toffile I dont see it
Its with us in the room though Its the bones
What bones The cellar bones out of the grave
That made him throw his bare legs out of bed
And sit up by me and take hold of me
I wanted to put out the light and see
If I could see it or else mow the room
With our arms at the level of our knees
And bring the chalkpile down Ill tell you what
Its looking for another door to try
The uncommonly deep snow has made him think
Of his old song The Wild Colonial Boy
He always used to sing along the toteroad
Hes after an open door to get outdoors
Lets trap him with an open door up attic
Toffile agreed to that and sure enough
Almost the moment he was given an opening
The steps began to climb the attic stairs
I heard them Toffile didnt seem to hear them
Quick  I slammed to the door and held the knob
Toffile get nails I made him nail the door shut
And push the headboard of the bed against it
Then we asked was there anything
Up attic that wed ever want again
The attic was less to us than the cellar
If the bones liked the attic let them have it
Let them stay in the attic When they sometimes
Come down the stairs at night and stand perplexed
Behind the door and headboard of the bed
Brushing their chalky skull with chalky fingers
With sounds like the dry rattling of a shutter
Thats what I sit up in the dark to say
To no one any more since Toffile died
2o3 Let them stay in the attic since they went there
I promised Toffile to be cruel to them
For helping them be cruel once to him
SON We think they had a grave down in the cellar
MOTHER We know they had a grave down in the cellar
SON We never could find out whose bones they were
MOTHER Yes we could too son Tell the truth for once
They were a mans his father killed for me
I mean a man he killed instead of me
The least I could do was to help dig their grave
We were about it one night in the cellar
Son knows the story but twas not for him
To tell the truth suppose the time had come
Son looks surprised to see me end a lie
Wed kept all these years between ourselves
So as to have it ready for outsiders
But tonight I dont care enough to lie
I dont remember why I ever cared
Toffile if he were here I dont believe
Could tell you why he ever cared himself
She hadnt found the fingerbone she wanted
Among the buttons poured out in her lap
I verified the name next morning Toffile
The rural letterbox said Toffile Lajway
Out walking in the frozen swamp one gray day
I paused and said I will turn back from here
No I will go on farther and we shall see
The hard snow held me save where now and then
One foot went through The view was all in lines
Straight up and down of tall slim trees
Too much alike to mark or name a place by
So as to say for certain I was here
Or somewhere else I was just far from home
A small bird flew before me He was careful
To put a tree between us when he lighted
And say no word to tell me who he was
Who was so foolish as to think what he thought
He thought that I was after him for a feather
The white one in his tail like one who takes
Everything said as personal to himself
One flight out sideways would have undeceived him
And then there was a pile of wood for which
I forgot him and let his little fear
Carry him off the way I might have gone
Without so much as wishing him goodnight
He went behind it to make his last stand
It was a cord of maple cut and split
And piled and measured four by four by eight
And not another like it could I see
No runner tracks in this years snow looped near it
And it was older sure than this years cutting
Or even last years or the years before
The wood was gray and the bark warping off it
And the pile somewhat sunken Clematis
Had wound strings round and round it like a bundle
What held it though on one side was a tree
Still growing and on one a stake and prop
These latter about to fall I thought that only
Someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks
Could so forget his handiwork on which
He spent himself the labor of his ax
And leave it there far from a useful fireplace
To warm the frozen swamp as best it could
With the slow smokeless burning of decay
Grief may have thought it was grief
Care may have thought it was care
They were welcome to their belief
The overimportant pair
No it took all the snows that clung
To the low roof over his bed
Beginning when he was young
To induce the one snow on his head
But whenever the roof camme white
The head in the dark below
Was a shade less the color of night
A shade more the color of snow
Grief may have thought it was grief
Care may have thought it was care
But neither one was the thief
Of his raven color of hair
I slumbered with your poems on my breast
Spread open as I dropped them halfread through
Like dove wings on a figure on a tomb
To see if in a dream they brought of you
I might not have the chance I missed in life
Through some delay and call you to your face
First soldier and then poet and then both
Who died a soldierpoet of your race
I meant you meant that nothing should remain
Unsaid between us brother and this remained
And one thing more that was not then to say
The Victory for what it lost and gained
You went to meet the shells embrace of fire
On Vimy Ridge and when you fell that day
The war seemed over more for you than me
But now for me than youthe other way
How over though for even me who knew
The foe thrust back unsafe beyond the Rhine
If I was not to speak of it to you
And see you pleased once more with words of mine
Love at the lips was touch
As sweet as I could bear
And once that seemed too much
I lived on air
That crossed me from sweet things
The flow of was it musk
From hidden grapevine springs
Down hill at dusk
I had the swirl and ache
From sprays of honeysuckle
That when theyre gathered shake
Dew on the knuckle
I craved strong sweets but those
Seemed strong when I was young
The petal of the rose
It was that stung
Now no joy but lacks salt
That is not dashed with pain
And weariness and fault
I crave the stain
Of tears the aftermark
Of almost too much love
The sweet of bitter bark
And burning clove
When stiff and sore and scarred
I take away my hand
From leaning on it hard
In grass and sand
The hurt is not enough
I long for weight and strength
To feel the earth as rough
To all my length
Come with rain O loud Southwester
Bring the singer bring the nester
Give the buried flower a dream
Make the settled snowbank steam
Find the brown beneath the white
But whateer you do tonight
Bath my window make it flow
Melt it as the ice will go
Melt the glass and leave the sticks
Like a hermits crucifix
Burst into my narrow stall
Swing the picture on the wall
Run the rattling pages oer
Scatter poems on the floor
Turn the poet out of door
Tree at my window window tree
My sash is lowered when night comes on
But let there never be curtain drawn
Between you and me
Vague dream head lifted out of the ground
And thing next most diffuse to cloud
Not all your light tongues talking aloud
Could be profound
But tree I have seen you taken and tossed
And if you have seen me when I slept
You have seen me when I was taken and swept
And all but lost
That day she put our heads together
Fate had her imagination about her
Your head so much concerned with outer
Mine with inner weather
Love and forgetting might have carried them
A little further up the mountain side
With night so near but not much further up
They must have halted soon in any case
With thoughts of a path back how rough it was
With rock and washout and unsafe in darkness
When they were halted by a tumbled wall
With barbedwire binding They stood facing this
Spending what onward impulse they still had
In One last look the way they must not go
On up the failing path where if a stone
Or earthslide moved at night it moved itself
No footstep moved it This is all they sighed
Goodnight to woods But not so there was more
A doe from round a spruce stood looking at them
Across the wall as near the wall as they
She saw them in their field they her in hers
The difficulty of seeing what stood still
Like some upended boulder split in two
Was in her clouded eyes they saw no fear there
She seemed to think that two thus they were safe
Then as if they were something that though strange
She could not trouble her mind with too long
She sighed and passed unscared along the wall
This then is all What more is there to ask
But no not yet A snort to bid them wait
A buck from round the spruce stood looking at them
Across the wall as near the wall as they
This was an antlered buck of lusty nostril
Not the same doe come back into her place
He viewed them quizzically with jerks of head
As if to ask Why dont you make some motion
Or give some sign of life Because you cant
I doubt if youre as living as you look
Thus till he had them almost feeling dared
To stretch a proffering hand and a spellbreaking
Then he too passed unscared along the wall
Two had seen two whichever side you spoke from
This must be all It was all Still they stood
A great wave from it going over them
As if the earth in one unlookedfor favour
Had made them certain earth returned their love
Out of the mud two strangers came
And caught me splitting wood in the yard
And one of them put me off my aim
By hailing cheerily Hit them hard
I knew pretty well why he had dropped behind
And let the other go on a way
I knew pretty well what he had in mind
He wanted to take my job for pay
Good blocks of oak it was I split
As large around as the chopping block
And every piece I squarely hit
Fell splinterless as a cloven rock
The blows that a life of selfcontrol
Spares to strike for the common good
That day giving a loose my soul
I spent on the unimportant wood
The sun was warm but the wind was chill
You know how it is with an April day
When the sun is out and the wind is still
Youre one month on in the middle of May
But if you so much as dare to speak
A cloud comes over the sunlit arch
A wind comes off a frozen peak
And youre two months back in the middle of March
A bluebird comes tenderly up to alight
And turns to the wind to unruffle a plume
His song so pitched as not to excite
A single flower as yet to bloom
It is snowing a flake and he half knew
Winter was only playing possum
Except in color he isnt blue
But he wouldnt advise a thing to blossom
The water for which we may have to look
In summertime with a witching wand
In every wheelruts now a brook
In every print of a hoof a pond
Be glad of water but dont forget
The lurking frost in the earth beneath
That will steal forth after the sun is set
And show on the water its crystal teeth
The time when most I loved my task
The two must make me love it more
By coming with what they came to ask
Youd think I never had felt before
The weight of an axhead poised aloft
The grip of earth on outspread feet
The life of muscles rocking soft
And smooth and moist in vernal heat
Out of the wood two hulking tramps
From sleeping God knows where last night
But not long since in the lumber camps
They thought all chopping was theirs of right
Men of the woods and lumberjacks
They judged me by their appropriate tool
Except as a fellow handled an ax
They had no way of knowing a fool
Nothing on either side was said
They knew they had but to stay their stay
And all their logic would fill my head
As that I had no right to play
With what was another mans work for gain
My right might be love but theirs was need
And where the two exist in twain
Theirs was the better rightagreed
But yield who will to their separation
My object in living is to unite
My avocation and my vocation
As my two eyes make one in sight
Only where love and need are one
And the work is play for mortal stakes
Is the deed ever really done
For Heaven and the futures sakes
A scent of ripeness from over a wall
And come to leave the routine road
And look for what had made me stall
There sure enough was an apple tree
That had eased itself of its summer load
And of all but its trivial foliage free
Now breathed as light as a ladys fan
For there had been an apple fall
As complete as the apple had given man
The ground was one circle of solid red
May something go always unharvested
May much stay out of our stated plan
Apples or something forgotten and left
So smelling their sweetness would be no theft
What things for dream there are when spectrelike
Moving among tall haycocks lightly piled
I enter alone upon the stubble field
From which the laborers voices late have died
And in the antiphony of afterglow
And rising full moon sit me down
Upon the full moons side of the first haycock
And lose myself amid so many alike
I dream upon the opposing lights of the hour
Preventing shadow until the moon prevail
I dream upon the nighthawks peopling heaven
Each circling each with vague unearthly cry
Or plunging headlong with fierce twang afar
And on the bats mute antics who would seem
Dimly to have made out my secret place
Only to lose it when he pirouettes
And seek it endlessly with purblind haste
On the last swallows sweep and on the rasp
In the abyss of odor and rustle at my back
That silenced by my advent finds once more
After an interval his instrument
And tries oncetwiceand thrice if I be there
And on the worn book of oldgolden song
I brought not here to read it seems but hold
And freshen in this air of withering sweetness
But on the memory of one absent most
For whom these lines when they shall greet her eye
When I was young my teachers were the old
I gave up fire for form till I was cold
I suffered like a metal being cast
I went to school to age to learn the past
Now when I am old my teachers are the young
What cant be molded must be cracked and sprung
I strain at lessons fit to start a suture
I got to school to youth to learn the future
What tree may not the fig be gathered from
The grape may not be gathered from the birch
Its all you know the grape or know the birch
As a girl gathered from the birch myself
Equally with my weight in grapes one autumn
I ought to know what tree the grape is fruit of
I was born I suppose like anyone
And grew to be a little boyish girl
My brother could not always leave at home
But that beginning was wiped out in fear
The day I swung suspended with the grapes
And was come after like Eurydice
And brought down safely from the upper regions
And the life I live nows an extra life
I can waste as I please on whom I please
So if you see me celebrate two birthdays
And give myself out of two different ages
One of them five years younger than I look
One day my brother led me to a glade
Where a white birch he knew of stood alone
Wearing a thin headdress of pointed leaves
And heavy on her heavy hair behind
Against her neck an ornament of grapes
Grapes I knew grapes from having seen them last year
One bunch of them and there began to be
Bunches all round me growing in white birches
The way they grew round Leif the Luckys German
Mostly as much beyond my lifted hands though
As the moon used to seem when I was younger
And only freely to be had for climbing
My brother did the climbing and at first
Threw me down grapes to miss and scatter
And have to hunt for in sweet fern and hardhack
Which gave him some time to himself to eat
But not so much perhaps as a boy needed
So then to make me wholly selfsupporting
He climbed still higher and bent the tree to earth
And put it in my hands to pick my own grapes
Here take a treetop Ill get down another
Hold on with all your might when I let go
I said I had the tree It wasnt true
The opposite was true The tree had me
The minute it was left with me alone
It caught me up as if I were the fish
And it the fishpole So I was translated
To loud cries from my brother of Let go
Dont you know anything you girl Let go
But I with something of the baby grip
Acquired ancestrally in just such trees
When wilder mothers than our wildest now
Hung babies out on branches by the hands
To dry or wash or tan I dont know which
Youll have to ask an evolutionist
I held on uncomplainingly for life
My brother tried to make me laugh to help me
What are you doing up there in those grapes
Dont be afraid A few of them wont hurt you
I mean they wont pick you if you dont them
Much danger of my picking anything
By that time I was pretty well reduced
To a philosophy of hangandlethang
Now you know how it feels my brother said
To be a bunch of foxgrapes as they call them
That when it thinks it has escaped the fox
By growing where it shouldnton a birch
Where a fox wouldnt think to look for it
And if he looked and found it couldnt reach it
Just then come you and I to gather it
Only you have the advantage of the grapes
In one way you have one more stem to cling by
And promise more resistance to the picker
One by one I lost off my hat and shoes
And still I clung I let my head fall back
And shut my eyes against the sun my ears
Against my brothers nonsense Drop he said
Ill catch you in my arms It isnt far
Stated in lengths of him it might not be
Drop or Ill shake the tree and shake you down
Grim silence on my part as I sank lower
My small wrists stretching till they showed the banjo strings
Why if she isnt serious about it
Hold tight awhile till I think what to do
Ill bend the tree down and let you down by it
I dont know much about the letting down
But once I felt ground with my stocking feet
And the world came revolving back to me
I know I looked long at my curledup fingers
Before I straightened them and brushed the bark off
My brother said Dont you weigh anything
Try to weigh something next time so you wont
Be run off with by birch trees into space
It wasnt my not weighing anything
So much as my not knowing anything
My brother had been nearer right before
I had not taken the first step in knowledge
I had not learned to let go with the hands
As still I have not learned to with the heart
And have no wish to with the heartnor need
That I can see The mindis not the heart
I may yet live as I know others live
To wish in vain to let go with the mind
Of cares at night to sleep but nothing tells me
That I need learn to let go with the heart
Lovers forget your love
And list to the love of these
She a window flower
And he a winter breeze
When the frosty window veil
Was melted down at noon
And the cagèd yellow bird
Hung over her in tune
He marked her through the pane
He could not help but mark
And only passed her by
To come again at dark
He was a winter wind
Concerned with ice and snow
Dead weeds and unmated birds
And little of love could know
But he sighed upon the sill
He gave the sash a shake
As witness all within
Who lay that night awake
Perchance he half prevailed
To win her for the flight
From the firelit lookingglass
And warm stovewindow light
But the flower leaned aside
And thought of naught to say
And morning found the breeze
A hundred miles away
