There´s a shadow on the sun I see it risin´
Kiss it away Kiss it away
And there´s hurt down deep inside that I been hidin´
Kiss it away Kiss it away
All the hard times we been through
We´d never mind them
We´d kiss ´em away we´d just kiss ´em away
But now I´m lookin for the good times and I can´t find them
Guess we kissed them away Must have kissed them away
Kiss away I keep thinkin´ the sun will shine once more
I´m never ready for the sudden rain
Don´t tell me I´m wrong ´cause I been told
I feel so wet and cold
Come my pain
You keep hopin´ things´ll change and I keep tryin´
One of these days maybe one of these days
But there´s a coldness in the air like somethin´ dyin'
Kiss it away Come and kiss it away
