Now a friend of mine way back in Chicago
You know he finally made his pile
Well he got himself a mansion on Butler and Sheff
An' he was livin' in the latest style
But I run into him he was eatin' in a greasy spoon
While parkled in front was his big limousine
I said 'Buddy you've got so much money
How come youre in here eatin' beans?'
An' he said
'After you've been havin' steak for a long time
Beans beans taste fine
An' after you've been drinkin' champagne and brandy
You gonna settle for wine.'
He said 'The world is funny and people are strange
And man is a creature of constant change and
After you've been havin' steak for a long time
Beans beans taste fine.'
Now you know I ran into another friend of mine
In a rowdy old Clark Street Bar
I said 'Friend is it true what I heard about you
I heard you married a beautiful 18-year-old shapely movie star
Yet here you sit tryin' to make out with some barfly
Who's too old and ugly to be true.'
He said 'Shelley you're still a very young man
So sit down I'll explain it all to you
He said
'After you've been havin' steak for a long time
Beans beans taste fine
An' after you've been drinkin' champagne and Chivas Regal
You gonna settle for Thunderbird wine.'
He said 'The world is funny and people are strange
And man is a creature of constant change and
After you've been havin' steak for a long time
Beans beans taste fine.'
