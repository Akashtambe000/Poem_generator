Everything's wrong
Days are too long
Sunshine's too hot
Wind is too strong
Clouds are too fluffy
Grass is too green
Ground is too dusty
Sheets are too clean
Stars are too twinkly
Moon is too high
Water's too drippy
Sand is too dry
Rocks are too heavy
Feathers too light
Kids are too noisy
Shoes are too tight
Folks are too happy
Singin' their songs
Why can't they see it
Everything's wrong
