I broke into the bank on Sunday
You should see the money I got
I couldn't drag it home 'til Monday
'Cause it sure weighed an awful lot
Then I sat down to count it
And much to my surprise
A whole lotta little brown little round coins
Rolled out before my eyes
Chorus
I've got a hundred thousand dollars worth of pennies
Not a solitary dollar or a dime
And I don't believe there's many
Rich men with a problem like mine
And I don't think this is any
Kind of ending to a perfect crime
I've got a hundred thousand dollars worth of pennies
And I'm spendin' it a penny at a time
Now a steak sure would taste delicious
And I've forgot how a beer would feel
But the man just might get suspicious
If I gave him eight hundred pennies for a meal
So I guess I'll just weigh myself again
And buy me another stick of gum
I've got a hundred thousand dollars worth of pennies Lord
And I'm livin' like a penniless bum
Chorus
I've got a hundred thousand dollars worth of pennies
Not a solitary dollar or a dime
And I don't believe there's many
Rich men with a problem like mine
