He'll be comin' down the road at the break of day
His head thrown back and his guns tied low
He's comin' after Jinny wants to take her away but I ain't gonna let her go
Oh he boasted in town but she loved him he said she'd be his with the sun
He said anyone try to stop him would be just one more notch on his gun
They say that he's headstrong and handsome his hair's blowin' wild and free
And they got a hold I ain't comin' cause he's a lot younger than me
And he'll be comin' down the road
He hasn't had much education he ain't worked a day in his life
He's livin' with some older woman they say she's another man's wife
But she wants him needs him and loves him she buys him his clothes and his meals
When she finds he's gone she'll be prayin' and Lord I know just how she feels
Because he's comin' down the road
The sun's at his back as he's comin' the smile is cruel on his lip
His right hand is slowly descendin' to the sixgun that rest on his hip
Then his lower lip strated tremble and he started cryin' as he looked up at me
And I picked him up I said son you're only four years old
And you know Jinny's only three
So come on in the house and have some cookies and milk
And he did and the tears turned to smiles
And I called up his mama I drove him home
And Jinny's safe at least for a little while
