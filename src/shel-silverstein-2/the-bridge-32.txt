This bridge will only take you halfway there
To those mysterious lands you long to see
Through gypsy camps and swirling Arab fairs
And moonlit woods where unicorns run free
So come and walk awhile with me and share
The twisting trails and wondrous worlds I've known
But this bridge will only take you halfway there
The last few steps you'll have to take alone
