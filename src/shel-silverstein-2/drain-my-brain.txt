Unwind my mind oh baby drain my brain
Unscrew my head take a part of my heart
Scrape away the pain and start all over again
I tell you baby I don't understand just how you can make love to me
While you're lookin' at the picture of another man
You got me talkin' to my elbow climbin' up the wall
First you tell me you despise me then you say you idolize me
Then you tell me you can't use me at all
Unwind my mind
 guitar 
Unwind my mind
I tell you baby I just can't go on
The hung up way that we're livin' while I'm doin' all the givin'
You keep on callin' me John
First you messin' with Charlie and then you jivin' with Jim
And I know you need a father but I really can't bother
Bein' all those other guys plus him
Unwind my mind
Unwind my mind settle my spine yeah unroll my soul yeah
