Someone ate the baby
It's rather sad to say
Someone ate the baby
So she won't be out to play
We'll never hear her whiney cry
Or have to feel if she is dry
We'll never hear her asking 'Why?'
Someone ate the baby
Someone ate the baby
It's absolutely clear
Someone ate the baby
'Cause the baby isn't here
We'll give away her toys and clothes
We'll never have to wipe her nose
Dad says 'That's the way it goes.'
Someone ate the baby
Someone ate the baby
What a frightful thing to eat
Someone ate the baby
Though she wasn't very sweet
It was a heartless thing to do
The policemen haven't got a clue
I simply can't imagine who
Would go and burp eat the baby
