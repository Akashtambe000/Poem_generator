If you want to marry me here's what you'll have to do
You must learn how to make a perfect chicken-dumpling stew
And you must sew my holey socks
And soothe my troubled mind
And develop the knack for scratching my back
And keep my shoes spotlessly shined
And while I rest you must rake up the leaves
And when it is hailing and snowing
You must shovel the walk and be still when I talk
And  hey  where are you going
