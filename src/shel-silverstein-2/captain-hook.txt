Captain Hook must remember
Not to scratch his toes
Captain Hook must watch out
And never pick his nose
Captain Hook must be gentle
When he shakes your hand
Captain Hook must be careful
Openin' sardine cans
And playing tag and pouring tea
And turnin' pages of his book
Lots of folks I'm glad I ain't
But mostly Captain Hook
