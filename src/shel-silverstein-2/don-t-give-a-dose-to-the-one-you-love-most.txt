Don’t give a dose to the one you love most
Give her some marmalade...give her some toast
You can give her the willies or give her the blues
But the dose that you give her will get back to youse
I once had a lady as sweet as a song
She was my darlin’ and she was my dear
But she had a dose and she passed it along
Now she’s gone but the dose is still there
So don’t give a dose to the one you love most
Give her some marmalade...give her some toast
You can give her a partiridge up in a pear tree
But the dose that you give her might get back to me
So if you’ve got an itchin’...if you’ve got a drip
Don’t sit there wishin’ for it to go ’way
If there’s a thing on the tip of your thing or your lip
Run down to the clinic today and say
'I won’t give a dose to the one I love most
I’ll give her some marmalade...give her some toast.'
Give her the willies or give her the blues
But the dose that you give her will get back to you
