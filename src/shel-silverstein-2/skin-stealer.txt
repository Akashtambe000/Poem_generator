This evening I unzipped my skin
And carefully unscrewed my head
Exactly as I always do
When I prepare myself for bed
And while I slept a coo-coo came
As naked as could be
And put on the skin
And screwed on the head
That once belonged to me
Now wearing my feet
He runs through the street
In a most disgraceful way
Doin' things and sayin' things
I'd never do or say
Ticklin' the children
And kickin' the men
And Dancin' the ladies away
So if he makes your bright eyes cry
Or makes your poor head spin
That scoundrel you see
Is not really me
He's the coo-coo
Who's wearing my skin
