A long time ago when the earth was green
and there was more kinds of animals than you've ever seen
and they run around free while the world was bein' born
and the lovliest of all was the Unicorn
There was green alligators and long-neck geese
There was humpy bumpy camels and chimpanzees
There was catsandratsandelephants but sure as you're born
the lovliest of all was the Unicorn
But the Lord seen some sinnin' and it caused him pain
He says 'Stand back I'm gonna make it rain.'
He says 'Hey Brother Noah I'll tell ya whatcha do
Go and build me a floatin' zoo
And you take two alligators and a couple of geese
two humpy bumpy camels and two chimpanzees
Take two catsandratsandelephants but sure as you're born
Noah don't you forget my Unicorn.'
Now Noah was there he answered the callin'
and he finished up the ark just as the rain was fallin'
He marched in the animals two by two
and he called out as they went through
'Hey Lord I got your two alligators and your couple of geese
your humpy bumpy camels and your chimpanzees
Got your catsandratsandelephants  but Lord I'm so forlorn
'cause I just don't see no Unicorn.'
Ol' Noah looked out through the drivin' rain
but the Unicorns were hidin' playin' silly games
They were kickin' and splashin' in the misty morn
oh them silly Unicorn
The the goat started goatin' and the snake started snakin'
the elephant started elephantin' and the boat started shaking'
The mouse started squeakin' and the lion started roarin'
and everyone's abourd but the Unicorn
I mean the green alligators and the long-neck geese
the humpy bumpy camels and the chimpanzees
Noah cried 'Close the door 'cause the rain is pourin' 
and we just can't wait for them Unicorn.'
Then the ark started movin' and it drifted with the tide
and the Unicorns looked up from the rock and cried
And the water come up and sort of floated them away 
that's why you've never seen a Unicorn to this day
You'll see a lot of alligators and a whole mess of geese
You'll see humpy bumpy camels and lots of chimpanzees
You'll see catsandratsandelephants but sure as you're born
you're never gonna see no Unicorn
