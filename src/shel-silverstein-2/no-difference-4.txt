Small as a peanut
Big as a giant
We're all the same size
When we turn off the light
Rich as a sultan
Poor as a mite
We're all worth the same
When we turn off the light
Red black or orange
Yellow or white
We all look the same
When we turn off the light
So maybe the way
To make everything right
Is for God to just reach out
And turn off the light
