No I do not want a kitten
No cute cuddly kitty-poo
No more long hair in my cornflakes
No more midnight meowing mews
No more scratchin' snarlin' spitters
No more sofas clawed to shreds
No more smell of kitty litter
No more mousies in my bed
No I will not take that kitten
I've had lice and I've had fleas
I've been scratched and sprayed and bitten
I've developed allergies
If you've got an ape I'll take him
If you have a lion that's fine
If you brought some walking bacon
Leave him here I'll treat him kind
I have room for mice and gerbils
I have beds for boars and bats
But please please take away that kitten
Quick--'fore it becomes a cat
Well...it is kind of cute at that
