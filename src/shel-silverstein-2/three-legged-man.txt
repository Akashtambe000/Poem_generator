Well now friends you'll never guess it so I really must confess it
I just met the sweetest woman of my long dismal life
But a friend of mine said 'Buddy just in case your mind is muddy
Don't you know that girl you're fooling with is Peg-Leg Johnson's wife
And that man is big and rough and mean and grim
And he'll brain you with his artificial limb
But next morning bright and early I stole old Peg-Leg's girlie
And I also took his wooden leg just to play it safe
But there weren't no time for laughter 'cause he started hopping after
And I keep on running faster but he won't give up the chase
And I'm running through the mountain with his bride
And I got his wooden leg here by my side
I'm a three-legged man with a two-legged woman
Being chased cross country by a one-legged fool
Though he's huffing and he's puffing and he shows no sign of stopping
I tell you boys this life is hard and cruel
'Cross the deserts and the valleys and the dark Chicago alleys
'Cross the mighty Mississippi to the hills of Caroline
Through the mountains of Montana and the swamps of Louisiana
Everytime that I look back he's JUST one foot behind
And I know he must be cold and wet and sick
But in spite of all his woes he can kick
Now he's ragged and he's filthy and I'm feeling mighty guilty
'Specially in the evenings when I hear him plead and beg
He says 'In spite of all your stealing friend I bear you no hard feelings
You can keep that darned old woman but please give me back my leg.'
'Cause although the one you meant to take was wooden
In the dark by mistake you took my good'un
