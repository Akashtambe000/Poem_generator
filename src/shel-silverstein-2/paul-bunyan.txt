He rode through the woods on a big blue ox
He had fists as hard as choppin' blocks
Five hundred pounds and nine feet tall...that's Paul
Talk about workin' when he swung his axe
You could hear it ring for a mile and a half
Then he'd yell'Timber!' and down she'd fall...for Paul
Talk about drinkin' that man's so mean
That he'd never drink nothin' but kerosene
And a five-gallon can is a little bit small...for Paul
Talk about tough well he once had a fight
With a thunderstorm on a cold dark night
I ain't sayin' who won
But it don't storm at all...round here...thanks to Paul
He was ninety years old when he said with a sigh
'I think I'm gonna lay right down and die
'Cause sunshine and sorrow I've seen it all...says Paul
He says 'There ain't no man alive can kill me
Ain't no woman 'round can thrill me
And I think heaven just mught be a ball'...says Paul
So he died...can we cried
It took eighteen men just to bust the ground
It took twenty-four more just to lower him down
And we covered him up and we figured that was all...for Paul
But late one night the trees started shakin'
The dogs started howlin' and the earth started quakin'
And out of the ground with a 'Hi y'all'...comes Paul
He shook the dirt from off his clothes
He scratched his butt and wiped his nose
'Y'kknow bein' dead wasn't no fun at all'...says Paul
He says 'Up in heaven they got harps on their knees
They got clouds and wings but they got no trees
I don't think that's much of a heaven at all'...says Paul
So he jumps on his ox with a fare-thee-well
He says 'I'll find out if there's trees in hell.'
And he rode away and that was all...we ever seen...of Paul
But the next time you hear a 'Timber!' yell
That sounds like it's comin' from the pits of hell
Then a weird and devilish ghostly wail
Like somebody's choppin' on the devil's tail
Then a shout a call a crash a fall
That ain't no mortal man at all...that's Paul
