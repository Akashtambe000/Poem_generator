Mama said I'd lose my head
If it wasn't fastened on
Today I guess it wasn't
'Cause while playing with my cousin
It fell off and rolled away
And now its gone
And I can't look for it
'Cause my eyes are in it
And I can't call to it
'Cause my mouth is on it
Couldn't hear me anyway
'Cause my ears are on it)
Can't even think about it
'Cause my brain is in it
So I guess I'll sit down
On this rock
And rest for just a minute…
