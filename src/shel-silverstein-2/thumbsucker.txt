I met her on a corner in Duluth
That’s the truth.
She was tryin’ to fix her shoe in a telephone booth
Her name was Ruth.
She said she was just waiting for a bus
But I hid my thumb cause I knew just what she was
And I ain’t gonna let no thumbsucker such my thumb
It’ll drive you crazy and leave you deaf and dumb
It’ll make you crawl and climb the wall
Leave you without no thumb at all
So I ain’t gonna let no thumbsucker suck my thumb
I’ll tell you what them thumbsuckers like to do
They suck your thumb till it’s wrinkled like a prune
They’ll say you’ve got the sweetest thumb of all
But then they suck the thumb of the guy livin’ down the hall
That’s why I ain’t gonna let no thumbsucker suck my thumb
etc   etc   until finally giving in.
