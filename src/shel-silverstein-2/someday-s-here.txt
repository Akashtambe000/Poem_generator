Well I've told you someday I'd have a lotta money
And you would see me grinnin' from ear to ear
Look in my pocket this ain't gabbage that I'm foldin' baby
Oh oh someday's here
And I told you someday I'll come driving up your driveway
In a Cadillac that stretched across from here to here
Look out your window this ain't no Mack truck I'm drivin' oh someday's here
Yeah you should have stucked with me just a little bit longer baby
When I was ragged and thin
You should have stuck with me till I got a little bit stronger baby
But you wanted the battle now you're up the creek without a paddle
Say I told you someday I'd have so many women
That if I try to count 'em it would take a year
Look in the back seat this ain't no football team I'm drivin' with
Aw someday's here
 harmonica 
You should have stuck with me
Say I told you someday you come crawlin' to me
Beggin' pleadin' scratchin' cryin' crocodile tears
Look at my feet is that my dog Rover no it's you
Aw someday's here hmm someday's here
