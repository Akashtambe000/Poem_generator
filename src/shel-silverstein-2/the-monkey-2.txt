1 little monkey
was goin' 2 the store
when he saw a banana 3
he'd never climbed be4
By 5 o'clock that evenin'
he was 6 with a stomach ache
'cause 7 green bananas
was what that monkey 8
By 9 o'clock that evenin'
that monkey was quite ill
so 10 we called the doctor
who was 11 on the hill
The doctor said 'You're almost dead
Don't eat green bananas no more.'
The sick little monkey groaned and said
'But that's what I 1-2 the 3-4.'
