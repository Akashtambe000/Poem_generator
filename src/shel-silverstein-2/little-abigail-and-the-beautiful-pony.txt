There was a girl named Abigail
Who was taking a drive
Through the country
With her parents
When she spied a beautiful sad-eyed
Grey and white pony
And next to it was a sign
That said
FOR SALE—CHEAP
“Oh,” said Abigail
“May I have that pony
May I please ”
And her parents said
“No you may not.”
And Abigail said
“But I MUST have that pony.”
And her parents said
'Well you can't have that pony.'
“Well you can have a nice butter pecan
Ice cream cone when we get home.”
And Abigail said
“I don’t want a butter pecan
Ice cream cone
I WANT THAT PONY
I MUST HAVE THAT PONY.”
And her parents said
“Be quiet and stop nagging
You’re not getting that pony.”
And Abigail began to cry and said
“If I don’t get that pony I’ll die.”
And her parents said “You won’t die
No child ever died yet from not getting a pony.”
And Abigail felt so bad
That when she got home she went to bed
And she couldn’t eat
And she couldn’t sleep
And her heart was broken
And she DID die
All because of a pony
That her parents wouldn’t buy
