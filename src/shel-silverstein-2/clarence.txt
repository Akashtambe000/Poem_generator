Clarence Lee from Tennessee
Loved the commercials he saw on TV
He watched with wide believing eyes
And bought everything they advertised 
Cream to make his skin feel better
Spray to make his hair look wetter
Bleach to make his white things whiter
Stylish jeans that fit much tighter
Toothpaste for his cavities
Powder for his doggie's fleas
Purple mouthwash for his breath
Deodorant to stop his sweat
He bought each cereal they presented
Bought each game that they invented
Then one day he looked and saw
'A brand-new Maw a better Paw
New improved in every way 
Hurry order yours today!'
So of course our little Clarence
Sent off for two brand-new parents
The new ones cam in the morning mail
The old ones he sold at a garage sale
And now they all are doing fine
His new folks treat him sweet and kind
His old ones work in an old coal mine
So if your Maw and Paw are mean
And make you eat your lima beans
And make you wash and make you wait
And never let you stay up late
And scream and scold and preach and pout
That simply means they're wearing out
So send off for two brand-new parents
And you'll be happy as little Clarence
