The honeymoon ended a decade ago
If he still loves her he don't say so
So she's taking her blues to the House af Tattoos
Getting little green buttons on her birthday suit
Little green buttons all in a row
From her face to the place they ain't never gonna slow
Might sound crazy but they sure look cute
Those little green buttons on her birthday suit
She had supper in the oven when he came home
Now he's snoring on the sofa to the Late Late Show
It was ten days later before he knew
'Bout those little green buttons on her birthday suit
But now she's living in a house of love
She's got his attention he can't get enough
He spends every evening trying to undo
The little green buttons on her birthday suit
