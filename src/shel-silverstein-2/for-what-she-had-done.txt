She had to die
This Omoo knew
He also knew he could not kill her
Not even try to kill her
Those eyes Would look at him Not even try
So what to do
There was one Ung Who lived in a cave
Beyond the hard mountain A foul cave
Far from the village
Ung who hunted with stones
Who killed with his hands
Who had killed two saber-tooths
And one great bear whose skin he now wore hanging from his hairy shoulders
And Ung had killed men Many men
And it was said a woman
Ung who took the fresh meat left upon the flat rock for the Spirit of the Sky
And the Spirit of the Sky would go hungry
And bring pain and darkness to the village
But none dare say words to Ung
Who had killed two saber-tooths
And one great bear And men many men
And it was said a woman
He went to Ung
Yes said Ung I will kill her
For what she has done said Omoo
For equal weight said Ung in bear meat or lizard skins
She is a large woman said Omoo
Equal wait said Ung Now you must come and show her to me that I may kill her
I cannot said Omoo
Then how will I know her
Her hair is long said Omoo
Her eyes burn like the pools of night
Many have the long hair said Ung
Many have eyes like the pool of night
She will be bathing said Omoo
Tomorrow as the sun dies
She will be bathing Washing her long hair at the falling water
Many women will be bathing said Ung
Many long-haired night-eyed women
How will I know it is she
Omoo thought
Ah he said she will be carrying flowers
Bright hill flowers that I shall gather and place in her hands before she goes to bathe at the falling water
Then you will know her
Then you will kill her
For equal weight said Ung
Yes said Omoo for equal weight
And so was begun the custom
Of giving bouquets and corsages
