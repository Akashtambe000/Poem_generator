Eight balloons no one was buyin'
All broke loose one afternoon
Eight balloons with strings a-flyin'
Free to do what they wanted to
One flew up to touch the sun  POP
One thought highways might be fun  POP
One took a nap in a cactus pile  POP
One stayed to play with a careless child  POP
One tried to taste some bacon fryin'  POP
One fell in love with a porcupine  POP
One looked close in a crocodile's mouth  POP
One sat around 'til his air ran out  WHOOSH
Eight balloons no one was buyin' 
They broke loose and away they flew
Free to float and free to fly
And free to pop where they wanted to
