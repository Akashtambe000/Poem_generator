Oh the Crocodile
Went to the dentist
And sat down in the chair
And the dentist said 'Now tell me sir
Why does it hurt and where?'
And the Crocodile said 'I'll tell you the truth
I have a terrible ache in my tooth.'
And he opened his jaws so wide so wide
That the dentist he climbed right inside
And the dentist laughed 'Oh isn't this fun?'
As he pulled the teeth out one by one
And the Crocodile cried 'You're hurting me so
Please put down your pliers and let me go.'
But the dentist just laughed with a Ho Ho Ho
And he said 'I still have twelve to go 
Oops that's the wrong one I confess
But what's one crocodile's tooth more or less?'
Then suddenly the jaws went snap
And the dentist was gone right off the map
And where he went one could only guess
To North or South or East or West
He left no forwarding address
But what's one dentist more or less
