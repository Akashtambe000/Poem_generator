Followin’ the trail on the old treasure map
I came to the spot that said “Dig right here.”
And four feet down my spade struck wood
Just where the map said a chest would appear
But carved in the side were written these words
“A curse upon he who disturbs this gold.”
Signed Morgan the Pirate Scourge of the Seas
I read these words and my blood ran cold
So here I sit upon untold wealth
Tryin’ to figure which is worse
How much do I need this gold
And how much do I need this curse
