Big Barney Fitch he got soddenly rich
He got a big fancy house in Melbourne
With buckets of loot and big black leather boots
Acting so haughty and well-born
But we of Australia we're children of convicts
And some of us wear it quite proudly
So as he rides by in his carriage so fine
I wave and I call to him loudly
Refrain
Was your grandma a whore was your grandpa a thief
Were they forgers and grafters who fell to their grief
If you're born of Australia I know who ya be
You're the son of a son of a scoundrel like me
Maggie McKay's got a sweet-lovin' way
And I know that she does adore me
But her parents they feel it would be a bad deal
They say that she's much too good for me
So as we said goodbye with a tear in her eye
They were smiling and glad of the breakin'
But they didn't look so proud when I shouted out loud
'Til the whole floggin' town was awakened
Refrain
Madam Marie loves the men from the sea
She says that they're good for business
Her daughters are found in a section of town
Known for a certain rudeness
Then the cops paid a call and the judge says 'That's all
It's time for a new profession'
Marie laughed out loud and in front of the crowd
Says 'Judge will you answer this question'
Refrain
