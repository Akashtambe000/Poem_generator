Dave McGunn was a surfin’ bum half–crazed by the blazin’ sun
From Waikiki to the Bering Sea he rode ’em one by one
Now he hung offshore ’bout a mile or more out where the dolphins played
And his wild eyes gleamed as he schemed and dreamed
To ride the perfect wave
Oh ride the perfect wave Dave ride the perfect wave
If you wait it out and you don’t sell out you may ride
The perfect wave
He crouched in the spray and he waited all day till the sun gave way to the moon
And his legs grew cold and he grew old and wrinkled like a prune
And the years rolled by and the surf broke high and the 40–foot breakers sprayed
But he sneered at ’em all sayin’ 'Too damn small I’m waitin’
For the perfect wave.'
He was sleepin’ on his board when he woke to a roar as thunder shook the sea
’Twas the dreaded California quake of 1973
And he stared at the reef in disbelief then paddled with tremblin’ hands
As a monstrous crashin’ tidal wave came roarin’ ’cross the land
It was 12 miles high and it filled the sky the color of boilin’ blood
And cities fell beneath its swell and mountains turned to mud
Its deadly surf engulfed the earth and left not a thing alive
And high on the tip with a smile on his lip was Davey hangin’ five
He hit the top of the Golden Gate at a thousand miles an hour
Over the top of the Empire State and the tip of the Eiffel Tower
And as he wiped out you could hear him shout as he plunged to a watery grave
'Hey hi dee hi I’m glad to die –– I’ve rode
The perfect wave.'
