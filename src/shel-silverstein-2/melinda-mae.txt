Have you heard of tiny Melinda Mae
Who ate a monstrous whale
She thought she could
She said she would
So she started in right at the tail
And everyone said,'You're much too small,'
But that didn't bother Melinda at all
She took little bites and she chewed very slow
Just like a little girl should
and eighty-nine years later she ate that whale
Because she said she would
