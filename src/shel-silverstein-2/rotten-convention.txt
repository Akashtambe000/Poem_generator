They had a Rotten Convention
And everyone was there
Hamburger Face and Gruesome Grace
And the Skull with the slimy hair
There was Mr Mud and the Creepin' Crud
And the Drooler and Belchin' Bob
There was Three-Headed Ann  she was holdin' hands
With the Whimperin' Simperin Slob
The Unpronounceable Name he came
And so did Saw-Nose Dan
And Poopin' Pete and Smelly Feet
And the Half-Invisible Man
There was Sudden Death and Sweat-Sock Breath
Big Barf and the Deadly Bore
And Killin' Dillon and other villains
We'd never seen before
And we all sat around and told bad tales
Of the rottenest people we knew
And everybody there kept askin' …
Where were you
