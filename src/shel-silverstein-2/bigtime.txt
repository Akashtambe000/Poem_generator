Hey dragged up my holly and I pull it to a town for the bigtime
Hey rig down the road I tore 'em down I'm a bigtime
I wheeled right in them swinging doors
Out through the window with half of that store
Everybody stopped and roared here comes Bigtime
Lemme grab me a bottle when I bit off a tap cause I'm bigtime
I do a 90 miles an hour in this speedin' trap and that's bigtime
I rolled up the telephone pole and then I kissed 15 women fought 16 men
I thought I'd start over again for another bigtime
And then a cop come up he said I see you've been enjoyin' quite a bigtime yeah
But you got to pay for what have been destroyed Mr Bigtime
I told that cop you better cut right out
Cause you're a little bitty man I'm a great big trout
I swung at him and the lights went out on my bigtime
Hey here I am coolin' in the country slam and this is the bigtime
The judge didn't believe how imprtant I am he gave me bigtime
And in the bunk above me there is a poor tempted soul
He shot his wife cause she sneezed untold
Hope he didn't catch cold here in the bigtime
Hey when I get out I can have it made I could be bigtime
Vause my safecracker buddies wanna teach me the trade in their bigtime
I thanked them kindly but I told them no when I get out I'm gonna take it slow
A cup of hot chocolade and a late late show will be my bigtime
Yea cup of hot chocolade and a late show will be my bigtime
