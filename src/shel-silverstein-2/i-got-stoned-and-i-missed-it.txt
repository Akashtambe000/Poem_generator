I was sitting in my basement
I just rolled myself a taste
of something green and gold and glorious
to get me through the day
Then my friend yelled through the transom
'Grab your coat and get your hat son
There's a nut down on the corner
givin' dollar bills away'
But I laid around a bit
Then I had another hit
Then I rolled myself a bauma
Then I thought about my mama
Then I fooled around played around
jacked around a while and then
I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned and it rolled right by
I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned oh me oh my
It took seven months of eargin
just to get that local virgin
with the sweet face
up to my place
to fool around a bit
Next day she woke up rosy
and she snuggled up so cosy
When she asked me how I liked it
Lord it hurts me to admit
I was stoned
I'm makin' no excuses
for the many things I uses
just to sweeten up my relationships
and brighten up my day
When my earthly race is over
and I'm ready for the clover
and they ask me how my life has been
I guess I'll have to say
I was stoned
