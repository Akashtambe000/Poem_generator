I opened my eyes
And looked up at the rain
And it dripped into my head
And flowed into my brain
So pardon this wild crazy thing I just said
I'm just not the same since there's rain in my head
I step very softly
I walk very slow
I can't do a hand-stand
Or I might overflow
And all I can hear as I lie in my bed
Is the slishity-slosh of the rain in my head
