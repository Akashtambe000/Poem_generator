'Twas sunset down in old Key West
The locals all were high
The tourists snapped their photographs
And munched their Key Lime pie
And meanwhile down at Sloppy Joe's
The drinks were standin' tall
With Buffett on the jukebox
And Hemingway on the wall
Then up spoke Sam the Shrimper
He said 'I've been a shrimper all my life
My daddy was a shrimper
And my mom's a shrimper's wife
And I'm tired of bein' a shrimper
Cuz a shrimper's life's too tame
So I'm gonna ride the Conch Train boys
And be like Jesse James
Gonna be like Jesse James boy
Gonna be like Jesse James
Case you didn't hear me the first three times
Gonna be like Jesse James.'
Now the Conch Train is a tourist toy
That rolls through Key West Town
Like some weird ride from Disneyland
It drives the tourists round and round
While the engineer on her P.A
Points out all the sites
'Well Tennessee did you-know-what
To you-know-who that night.'
'The tourists all have money' said Sam
'Their wives all have rings of gold
Their mopeds all are pawnable
Their cameras can be sold
And think of all the glory boys
The money and the fame
To be the first and only man
To rob the Key West Train.'
Now the engineer of the Conch Train
Her name was Betsy Wright
She drove the Conch Train all day long
And loved Shrimper Sam all night
And with some sweet persuasion
She agreed to join the game
She'd slow it down and flag the lad
And let him ride the train
The conch train made its turn
Down the Smathers Pitch
When Shrimper Sam with a snorkle eye
Leaped naked from the sea
His fillet knife was in his hand
He jumped aboard the train
'Give up your bucks you tourist schmucks
I'm Key West Jesse James
I'm Key West Jesse James boy
Key West Jesse James
Case you didn't hear me the first three times
I'm Key West Jesse James.'
Now unbeknownst to Shrimper Sam
In the third car from the rear
Sat Kelso Bolls from Muscle Shoals
An American Legioneer
He was a redneck of respect
And a marksman of reknown
From under his fat
He drew a Gat
And shot the shrimper down
Now the first time that he shot poor Sam
Sam groaned and clutched his side
The second time that he shot poor Sam
Sam fell to his knees and cried
And the third time that he shot poor Sam
You could see in both their eyes
Lash LaRue and Randolph Scott
Beneath the Western skies
We laid poor Sam upon the sand
And we lifted up his head
We listened close to hear the words
The dying shrimper said
He said 'Boys you know I had my chance
But I went and botched the job
But how can a boy named Jesse James
Without a train to rob?'
Then Kelso Bolls took off his hat
And the tears streamed down his face
He said 'Son I know just how you feel
This world's a changin' place'
When history is written
Uh they won't recall our names
But I only got to play Pat Garrett
Cuz you played Jesse James
We buried Sam in the southernmost sands
Close by the southernmost waves
Where sweet Betsy Wright
Cries tears every night
Onto his southernmost grave
And on his tombstone say the words
'Stick to your own game
And if you are a shrimper
Do not try to rob a train.'
