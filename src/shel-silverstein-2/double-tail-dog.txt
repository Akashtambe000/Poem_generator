Would you like to buy a dog with a tail at either end
He is quite the strangest dog there is in town
Though he's not too good at knowing
just exactly where he's going
He is very very good at sitting down
He doesn't have a place to put a collar
And I'll admit it's rather hard to lead him
And he cannot hear you call
For he has no ears at all
But it doesn't cost a single cent to feed him
He cannot bite he'll never bark or growl
Just scratch him on his tails he'll find it pleasing
But you'll have to take him out
For twice as many walks
And I'll bet that you can quickly guess the reason
