Did you hear bout Stacy brown no we didn't but we'd like to
He had every chick in town no he didn't but he tried to
He had looks he had class do anything to get a little lass
And everyone would shout at him when he walks his girlies past
They said everybody got one everybody got one
Everybody got one everybody got one Stacy brown got two oooh
Do you know the reason for his success no we don't so tell us
They say that he was double blessed not like you fellas
They say that Stacy Brown was born just a little bit deformed
Still his girl friends they all wake up smilin' every morn
Singin' everybody got one
 guitar  Why they're climbin' up the wall just to get to Stacy
Young ones run and old ones crawl he drives us crazy
He got two and that's a fact but no one knows where the other one's at
On his elbow on his knee or underneath his hat
Singin' everybody got one
He got two I tell you truth it's a fact no I ain't seen her but no I mean it's a fact
Well that's what my old lady told me
No I don't I don't why she knows how did she know
Maybe somebody told her huh gossip maybe it's gossip how did she know
Maybe just seems like two I wanna talk to that woman
