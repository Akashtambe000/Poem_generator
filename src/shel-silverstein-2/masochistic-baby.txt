Oh ever since my Masochistic Baby went and left me
I got nothin’ to hit but the wall
She loved me when I beat her
But I started actin’ sweeter
And that was no way to treat her at all
Yes she is the one that I’m dreamin’ of
And you always hurt the one you love
And ever since my Masochistic Baby went and left me
I got nothin’ to hit but the wall oh no
Nothin’ to beat but the eggs
Nothin’ to belt but my pants
Nothin’ to whip but the cream
Nothin’ to punch but the clock
Nothin’ to strike but a match
