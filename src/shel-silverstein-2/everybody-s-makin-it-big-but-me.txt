Elvis he's a hero he's a superstar
And I hear that Paul McCartney drives a Rolls Royse car
And Dylan sings for millions
And I just sing for free
Oh everybody's makin' it big but me
Oh everybody's makin' it big but me
Everybody's makin' it big but me
Neil Diamond sings for diamonds
And here's ole rhinestone me
Oh everybody's makin' it big but me
Well I hear that Alice Cooper's got a foxy chick
To wipe off his snake keep him rich
And Elton John's got two fine ladies
And Doctor John's got three
And I'm still seein' them same old sleezoes
That I used to see
Oh everybody's makin' it big but me
Everybody's makin' it big but me
I've got charisma
And personality
How come everybody's makin' it big but me
Well I paint my face with glitter
Just like Bowie does
And I wear the same mascara
That Mick Jagger does
And I even put some lipstick on
That just hurt my dad and mom
Everybody's makin' it big but me
They got groupies for their bands
And all I got is my right hand
And everybody's makin' it big but me
