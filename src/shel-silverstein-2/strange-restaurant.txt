I said 'I'll take the T-bone steak.'
A soft voice mooed 'Oh wow.'
And I looked up and realized
The waitress was a cow
I cried 'Mistake--forget the the steak
I'll take the chicken then.'
I heard a cluck--'twas just my luck
The busboy was a hen
I said 'Okay no fowl today
I'll have the seafood dish.'
Then I saw through the kitchen door
The cook--he was a fish
I screamed 'Is there anyone workin' here
Who's an onion or a beet
No Your're sure Okay then friends
A salad's what I'll eat.'
They looked at me 'Oh,no,' they said
'The owner is a cabbage head.'
