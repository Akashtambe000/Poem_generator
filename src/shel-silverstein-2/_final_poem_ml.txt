I broke into the bank on Sunday
You should see the money I got
I couldnt drag it home til Monday
Cause it sure weighed an awful lot
Then I sat down to count it
And much to my surprise
A whole lotta little brown little round coins
Rolled out before my eyes
Chorus
Ive got a hundred thousand dollars worth of pennies
Not a solitary dollar or a dime
And I dont believe theres many
Rich men with a problem like mine
And I dont think this is any
Kind of ending to a perfect crime
Ive got a hundred thousand dollars worth of pennies
And Im spendin it a penny at a time
Now a steak sure would taste delicious
And Ive forgot how a beer would feel
But the man just might get suspicious
If I gave him eight hundred pennies for a meal
So I guess Ill just weigh myself again
And buy me another stick of gum
Ive got a hundred thousand dollars worth of pennies Lord
And Im livin like a penniless bum
Chorus
Ive got a hundred thousand dollars worth of pennies
Not a solitary dollar or a dime
And I dont believe theres many
Rich men with a problem like mine
Theyre buildin the gallows outside my cell
I got 25 minutes to go
And in 25 minutes Ill be in Hell
I got 24 minutes to go
Well they give me some beans for my last meal
23 minutes to go
And you know nobody asked me how I feel
I got 22 minutes to go
So I wrote to the Govnor the whole damned bunch
Ahhh 21 minutes to go
And I call up the Mayor and hes out to lunch
I got 20 more minutes to go
Well the Sheriff says Boy I wanna watch you die
19 minutes to go
I laugh in his face and I spit in his eye
I got 18 minutes to go
WellI call out to the Warden to hear my plea
17 minute to go
He says Call me back in a week or three
Youve got 16 minutes to go
Well my lawyer says hes sorry he missed my case
Mmmm15 minutes to go
Yeah well if youre so sorry come up and take my place
I got 14 minutes to go
Well now here comes the padre to save my soul
With 13 minutes to go
And hes talkin about burnin but Im so damned cold
I got 12 more minutes to go
Now theyre testin the trap It chills my spine
I got 11 minutes to go
Cuz the goddamned thing it works just fine
I got 10 more minutes to go
Im waitin for the pardon gonna set me free
With 9 more minutes to go
But this aint the movies so to hell with me
I got 8 more minutes to go
And now Im climbin up the ladder with a scaffold peg
With 7 more minutes to go
Ive betta watch my step or else Ill break my leg
I got 6 more minutes to go
Yeah with my feet on the trap and my head in the noose
5 more minutes to go
Well cmon somethin and cut me loose
I got 4 more minutes to go
I can see the mountains I see the sky
3 more minutes to go
And its too damned pretty for a man to die
i got 2 more minutes to go
I can hear the buzzards hear the crows
1 more minute to go
And now Im swingin and here I gooooooooo
Well my daddy left home when I was three
and he didnt leave much to Ma and me
just this old guitar and a bottle of booze
Now I dont blame him because he run and hid
but the meanest thing that he ever did was
before he left he went and named me Sue
Well he must have thought it was quite a joke
and it got lots of laughs from a lot of folks
it seems I had to fight my whole life through
Some gal would giggle and Id get red
and some guy would laugh and Id bust his head
I tell you life aint easy for a boy named Sue
Well I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
Roamed from town to town to hide my shame
but I made me a vow to the moon and the stars
Id search the honky tonks and bars and kill
that man that gave me that awful name
But it was Gatlinburg in mid July and I had
just hit town and my throat was dry
Id thought id stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon in a street of mud
and at a table dealing stud sat the dirty
mangy dog that named me Sue
Well I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
from a wornout picture that my mother had
and I knew the scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
and I looked at him and my blood ran cold
and I said My name is Sue How do you do
Now youre gonna die Yeah thats what I told him
Well I hit him right between the eyes and he went down
but to my surprise he came up with a knife
and cut off a piece of my ear But I busted a chair
right across his teeth And we crashed through
the wall and into the street kicking and agouging
in the mud and the blood and the beer
I tell you Ive fought tougher men but I really cant remember when
He kicked like a mule and bit like a crocodile
I heard him laughin and then I heard him cussin
he went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there looking at me and I saw him smile
And he said Son this world is rough and if
a mans gonna make it hes gotta be tough
and I knew I wouldnt be there to help you along
So I gave you that name and I said Goodbye
I knew youd have to get tough or die And its
that name that helped to make you strong
Yeah he said Now you have just fought one
helluva fight and I know you hate me and youve
got the right to kill me now and I wouldnt blame you
if you do But you ought to thank me
before I die for the gravel in your guts and the spit
in your eye because Im the guy that named you Sue
Yeah what could I do What could I do
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
called him pa and he called me a son
and I came away with a different point of view
and I think about him now and then
Every time I tried every time I win and if I
ever have a son I think I am gonna name him
Bill or George anything but Sue
Ive got a couple more years on you babythats all
Ive had more chances to fly and more places to fall
And it aint that Im wiser
Its only that Ive spent more time with my back to the wall
And Ive picked up a couple more years on you baby thats all
Ive walked a couple more roads than you babythats all
And Im tired of runnin while youre only learning to crawl
And youre headin somewhere
But Ive been to somewhere and found it was nowhere at all
And Ive picked up a couple of years on you baby thats all
Now sayin goodbye girl dont never come easy at all
But youve got to fly cuz youre hearin those young eagles call
And someday when youre older youll smile at a man strong and tall
And youll say Ive got a couple more years on you baby thats all
Ive got a couple more years on you baby thats all
Youll say Ive had more chances to fly and more places to fall
It aint that Im wiser
Its only that Ive spent more time with my back to the wall
And Ive picked up a couple more years on you baby thats all
Now you know some fellahs they want fame and fortune
Yeah and other fellahs they just wanna swing
But all I wanted all my life
Was a TV set and a truck and a wife
And a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing
Yeah the TV and the truck I got on credit
And I got that girl with a little old Woolworth ring
And life was warm and life was sweet
But still it was kinda incomplete
Without a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing
chorus
Hey John you walk the line
Do Deelia one more time
And when you do them Cottonfields
You warm this heart of mine
So one day I thought Hey Im gonna do it
Thats what I said
So I mortgaged the farm and pawned her wedding ring
I sold the gold tooth out of my mouth
And jumped in the pickup and headed South
For a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing
I hit Nashville cold and wet and hungry
I said Im here bring him on let him do his thing
But they told me down at the Old Pit Grill
Id have to go all the way to Andersonville
For a front row seat to hear ole Jonny sing
I found his house knocked on the door and it was opened
By a brownhaired girl and a baby with a teethin ring
I said I seen you somewhere before
but dont stand there and block the door
I want a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing
chorus
She said Id have to go down to The Opry
And the feller there said Id have to wait till Spring
He said Weve been sold out for months and months
And this poor insane fellah wants
A front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing
Well he said a couple more things and I started cryin
And then he laughed at me and thats when I started to swing
Well I bust through the doors in a roaring rage
Crawled over the crowd till I reached the stage
For a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing
chrous
Then some crazy guard started shootin
I shot back and the next thing I know I was winged
and on the floor
When a guy in a voice kinda deep and low
Says Boy thats a mighty long way to go
For a front row seat to hear ANYBODY sing
And I guess that judge he werent no music lover
I got fifteen months but that dont mean a thing
Cos yesterday in the prison yard
A show come through and HAR de HAR
I had a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing
chorus plus some typical Shel ranting and raving
Theres a light on in the attic
Thought the house is dark and shuttered
I can see a flickerin flutter
And I know what its about
Theres a light on in the attic
I can see it from the outside
And I know youre on the inside lookin out
She was dancin when I seen her in a Mexican cantina
In a neighborhood they call La Zona Roja
She had a childs smile but she told me in a while
It would take a lot of gold to get to know her
Acapulco Goldie donde did you go
You said youd always hold me
But you run away with me Acapulco Gold
I knew theres no one cuter then she said she was a puta
I said What does puta mean And she told meoh no
Then we went to meet a dealer we smoke and drink tequila
Then the lights went out and I guess thats when she rolled me
Just like Acapulco Goldie por que did you go
You said youd always hold me
But you vamos away with me Acapulco Gold
Ya ya you run away with me Acapulco Gold
Alimony alimony I work till my fingers are bloody and boney

Took a little time to find each other
Baby We got all the time in the world

We got everything we need
To plant a lovin seed
And all the time we need to watch it grow
Stay down
Stay at least until the fire stops burnin
At least until the room has stopped its turnin
And when the embers dyin
Were lyin in the afterglow
Itll be as sweet as anything weve ever known
Baby We got all the time in the world
So why dont we just take it nice and slow
We got everything we need
To plant a lovin seed
And all the time we need to watch it grow

Backward Bill Backward Bill
He lives way up on Backward Hill
Which is really a hole in the sandy ground
But thats a hill turned upside down
Backward Bills got a backward shack
With a big front porch thats built out back
You walk through the window and look out the door
And the cellar is up on the very top floor
Backward Bill he rides like the wind
Dont know where hes going but sees where hes been
His spurs they go neigh and his horse it goes clang
And his sixgun goes gnab it never goes bang
Backward Bills got a backward pup
They eat their supper when the sun comes up
And hes got a wife named Backward Lil
Shes my own true hate says Backward Bill
Backward Bill wears his hat on his toes
And puts on his underwear over his clothes
And come every payday he pays his boss
And rides off asmilin acarryin his hoss
The baby bat
Screamed out in fright
Turn on the dark
Im afraid of the light
Now a friend of mine way back in Chicago
You know he finally made his pile
Well he got himself a mansion on Butler and Sheff
An he was livin in the latest style
But I run into him he was eatin in a greasy spoon
While parkled in front was his big limousine
I said Buddy youve got so much money
How come youre in here eatin beans
An he said
After youve been havin steak for a long time
Beans beans taste fine
An after youve been drinkin champagne and brandy
You gonna settle for wine
He said The world is funny and people are strange
And man is a creature of constant change and
After youve been havin steak for a long time
Beans beans taste fine
Now you know I ran into another friend of mine
In a rowdy old Clark Street Bar
I said Friend is it true what I heard about you
I heard you married a beautiful 18yearold shapely movie star
Yet here you sit tryin to make out with some barfly
Whos too old and ugly to be true
He said Shelley youre still a very young man
So sit down Ill explain it all to you
He said
After youve been havin steak for a long time
Beans beans taste fine
An after youve been drinkin champagne and Chivas Regal
You gonna settle for Thunderbird wine
He said The world is funny and people are strange
And man is a creature of constant change and
After youve been havin steak for a long time
Beans beans taste fine
Theres a polar bear
In our Frigidaire
He likes it cause its cold in there
With his seat in the meat
And his face in the fish
And his big hairy paws
In the buttery dish
Hes nibbling the noodles
Hes munching the rice
Hes slurping the soda
Hes licking the ice
And he lets out a roar
If you open the door
And it gives me a scare
To know hes in there
That polary bear
In our Fridgitydaire
Hey the truth might hurt so Im tellin you now that you better not ask me
Hey you better not ask me where I been all night
Why my eyes are shinin and my spirit is flyin
You better not ask if I been doin right or I just might tell you
And you better not ask me bout the girls I used to know
And days I used to run around before I ever met you
You better not ask how they compare to you or I just might tell you
And you better not ask me if Im satisfied
With the way youve been givin me what you call lovin
Better not ask me bout the times I cried or I just might tell you
So keep on doin what youre doin and if you should see me straight
Well dont you ask baby just let it pass baby
And maybe itll go away but I dont doubt it
You better not ask me if Im gonna stick around
Or pack up all my bags and find another pretty city
You better not ask me who it is I found or I just might tell you
Hey dragged up my holly and I pull it to a town for the bigtime
Hey rig down the road I tore em down Im a bigtime
I wheeled right in them swinging doors
Out through the window with half of that store
Everybody stopped and roared here comes Bigtime
Lemme grab me a bottle when I bit off a tap cause Im bigtime
I do a 90 miles an hour in this speedin trap and thats bigtime
I rolled up the telephone pole and then I kissed 15 women fought 16 men
I thought Id start over again for another bigtime
And then a cop come up he said I see youve been enjoyin quite a bigtime yeah
But you got to pay for what have been destroyed Mr Bigtime
I told that cop you better cut right out
Cause youre a little bitty man Im a great big trout
I swung at him and the lights went out on my bigtime
Hey here I am coolin in the country slam and this is the bigtime
The judge didnt believe how imprtant I am he gave me bigtime
And in the bunk above me there is a poor tempted soul
He shot his wife cause she sneezed untold
Hope he didnt catch cold here in the bigtime
Hey when I get out I can have it made I could be bigtime
Vause my safecracker buddies wanna teach me the trade in their bigtime
I thanked them kindly but I told them no when I get out Im gonna take it slow
A cup of hot chocolade and a late late show will be my bigtime
Yea cup of hot chocolade and a late show will be my bigtime
The hard coals called bituminous
Or is that anthracite
Stalactites grow down from caves
Or do I mean stalagmites
Those fluffy clounds are nimbus
No wait they might be cumulus
And that kid who was raised by wolves
Was he Remus or Romulus
The brothauruses ate no meat
Does that mean theyre carnivorous
Or were they brontosauruses
And were they herbivorous
A camel is a pachyderm
Or do I mean dromedary
Is this match inflammable
I thought it was incendiary
Octagons no hexagons
No heptagons have seven sides
And dont spray fruit with pesticides
Or do I mean insecticides
If I can see right through a thing
Is it transparent or translucent
These are just some of the things
I find confusingor confuscent
Oh Im being eaten
By a boa constrictor
A boa constrictor
A boa constrictor
Im being eaten by a boa constrictor
And I dont like itone bit
Well what do you know
Its nibblin my toe
Oh gee
Its up to my knee
Oh my
Its up to my thigh
Oh fiddle
Its up to my middle
Oh heck
Its up to my neck
Oh dread
Its upmmmmmmmmmmffffffffff
I used to be a prancer
a oneeyed song and dancer
But eyes for true romance
I didnt even try
Id getem and forgetem
But I never could stay withem
Cause I thought my well of love had done run dry
But now its bubblin up
I feel it bubblin up
And you cant hold back this true love
no matter what you do
Because its bubblin up
you can hear it baby
Its bubblin up
And itll soon be bubblin over just for you
Get that look off your face
I know the one I met you
You loved me and I let you
But Id gladly bet you
that it wouldnt last too long
But I had no way of knowing
that this thing would keep on growin
And now the feeling still is going strong
And yes its bubblin up
In a pad with no heat up on Sullivan Street
The last of the hipsters lay dyin
Wearin his shades so like no one could tell
Like whether or not he was cryin
All the junkies and loners
An coffee shop owners
Were all gathered round his bed
He took one last puff
Of some imported stuff
And this are the last words he said
He said Send my sandals home to Mom
Hang my Tshirt away
Burn my guitar
In Washington Squar
Cause I never learned how to play
Give my pad
To some needy lad
And tell him the rent is all paid
Keep my cash
An my stash
An my hash
But bury me in my shades
Bury me in my shades boys
Bury me in my shades
Burn my guitar
In Washington Squar
But bury me in my shades
He said Give my Brooklyn chicks away
To anyone who needs em
Give all of my poems away
To anyone wholl read em
Dig me a grave neath the coffeeshop
And let a sad folksong be played
Get everyone high
On the moment I die
Bury me in my shades
Bury me in my shades boys
Bury me in my shades
Burn my guitar
In Washington Squar
But bury me in my shades
We threw his sandals out in the hall
We left his Tshirt lay
We sold his guitar
At the corner bar
To someone who knew how to play
We smoked all his stash
And spent all his cash
And threw all his poems away
And Bob got his records
And Ed got his books
And I got the poor beatnik shades
Bury me in my shades boys he said
Bury me in my shades
Burn my guitar
In Washington Squar
But bury me in my shades
Captain Hook must remember
Not to scratch his toes
Captain Hook must watch out
And never pick his nose
Captain Hook must be gentle
When he shakes your hand
Captain Hook must be careful
Openin sardine cans
And playing tag and pouring tea
And turnin pages of his book
Lots of folks Im glad I aint
But mostly Captain Hook
Oh the changing of the seasons its a pretty thing to see
And though I find this balmy weather pleasin
Theres the wind come from tomorrow and I hear it callin me
And Im bound for the changing of the seasons
Oh its blowin in Chicago and its snowin up in Maine
And the Islands to the south are warm and sunny
And Ive got to feel the earth shake and I gotta feel the rain
And Ive got to know a taste of more than honey
So dont ask me where Im goin or how long Im gonna be away
Dont make me give you all the hollow reasons
Ill think of you like summer and I might be back some day
When my heart miss the changing of the seasons
Oh its blowin in Chicago

And I wish I could explain you why Im leavin
But theres some men need the winter and theres some men need the sun
And theres some men need the changing of the seasons
Yeah its blowin in Chicago

Clarence Lee from Tennessee
Loved the commercials he saw on TV
He watched with wide believing eyes
And bought everything they advertised
Cream to make his skin feel better
Spray to make his hair look wetter
Bleach to make his white things whiter
Stylish jeans that fit much tighter
Toothpaste for his cavities
Powder for his doggies fleas
Purple mouthwash for his breath
Deodorant to stop his sweat
He bought each cereal they presented
Bought each game that they invented
Then one day he looked and saw
A brandnew Maw a better Paw
New improved in every way
Hurry order yours today
So of course our little Clarence
Sent off for two brandnew parents
The new ones cam in the morning mail
The old ones he sold at a garage sale
And now they all are doing fine
His new folks treat him sweet and kind
His old ones work in an old coal mine
So if your Maw and Paw are mean
And make you eat your lima beans
And make you wash and make you wait
And never let you stay up late
And scream and scold and preach and pout
That simply means theyre wearing out
So send off for two brandnew parents
And youll be happy as little Clarence
Ill tell you the story of Cloony the Clown
Who worked in a circus that came through town
His shoes were too big and his hat was too small
But he just wasnt just wasnt funny at all
He had a trombone to play loud silly tunes
He had a green dog and a thousand balloons
He was floppy and sloppy and skinny and tall
But he just wasnt just wasnt funny at all
And every time he did a trick
Everyone felt a little sick
And every time he told a joke
Folks sighed as if their hearts were broke
And every time he lost a shoe
Everyone looked awfully blue
And every time he stood on his head
Everyone screamed Go back to bed
And every time he made a leap
Everybody fell asleep
And every time he ate his tie
Everyone began to cry
And Cloony could not make any money
Simply because he was not funny
One day he said Ill tell this town
How it feels to be an unfunny clown
And he told them all why he looked so sad
And he told them all why he felt so bad
He told of Pain and Rain and Cold
He told of Darkness in his soul
And after he finished his tale of woe
Did everyone cry Oh no no no
They laughed until they shook the trees
With HahHahHahs and HeeHeeHees
They laughed with howls and yowls and shrieks
They laughed all day they laughed all week
They laughed until they had a fit
They laughed until their jackets split
The laughter spread for miles around
To every city every town
Over mountains cross the sea
From Saint Tropez to Mun San Nee
And soon the whole world rang with laughter
Lasting till forever after
While Cloony stood in the circus tent
With his head drooped low and his shoulders bent
And he saidTHAT IS NOT WHAT I MEANT
IM FUNNY JUST BY ACCIDENT
And while the world laughed outside
Cloony the Clown sat down and cried
The Moon she is a pretty girl who lives up in the stars
And that old cloud hes a great old man who loves her from afar
He loves her from afar
When Lady Moon smiles down on him ol Cloud is all awonder
So he starts to sing to her and thats what makes the thunder
Cant ya listen baby thats what makes the thunder
Love is just a cloudy sky as far as I can see
And that ol cloud up in the sky he got much chance in love as me
And some dry nights she wont come out when she hears him callin
The tears come streamin on down his cheeks and thats the rain a fallin
Dont ya feel it baby hats the rain a fallin
Love is just a cloudy sky as far as I can see
And that ol cloud up in the skys got as much a chance in love as me
And when the night starts to gettin light and he can see her goin
He throws a kiss across the sky and thats the wind a blowin
Cant ya feel it honey thats the wind a blowin
Oh love is just a cloudy sky as far as I can see
And that ol cloud up in the sky hes got as much a chance as me
He got as much a chance as me
My skin is kind of sort of brownish
Pinkish yellowish white
My eyes are greyish blueish green
But Im told they look orange in the night
My hair is reddish blondish brown
But its silver when its wet
And all the colors I am inside
Have not been invented yet
Hell be comin down the road at the break of day
His head thrown back and his guns tied low
Hes comin after Jinny wants to take her away but I aint gonna let her go
Oh he boasted in town but she loved him he said shed be his with the sun
He said anyone try to stop him would be just one more notch on his gun
They say that hes headstrong and handsome his hairs blowin wild and free
And they got a hold I aint comin cause hes a lot younger than me
And hell be comin down the road
He hasnt had much education he aint worked a day in his life
Hes livin with some older woman they say shes another mans wife
But she wants him needs him and loves him she buys him his clothes and his meals
When she finds hes gone shell be prayin and Lord I know just how she feels
Because hes comin down the road
The suns at his back as hes comin the smile is cruel on his lip
His right hand is slowly descendin to the sixgun that rest on his hip
Then his lower lip strated tremble and he started cryin as he looked up at me
And I picked him up I said son youre only four years old
And you know Jinnys only three
So come on in the house and have some cookies and milk
And he did and the tears turned to smiles
And I called up his mama I drove him home
And Jinnys safe at least for a little while
They said come skating
They said its so nice
They said come skating
Id done it twice
They said come skating
It sounded nice…
I wore roller
They meant ice
Oh the Crocodile
Went to the dentist
And sat down in the chair
And the dentist said Now tell me sir
Why does it hurt and where
And the Crocodile said Ill tell you the truth
I have a terrible ache in my tooth
And he opened his jaws so wide so wide
That the dentist he climbed right inside
And the dentist laughed Oh isnt this fun
As he pulled the teeth out one by one
And the Crocodile cried Youre hurting me so
Please put down your pliers and let me go
But the dentist just laughed with a Ho Ho Ho
And he said I still have twelve to go
Oops thats the wrong one I confess
But whats one crocodiles tooth more or less
Then suddenly the jaws went snap
And the dentist was gone right off the map
And where he went one could only guess
To North or South or East or West
He left no forwarding address
But whats one dentist more or less

Youd stare at the heavens with wide open eyes
And the wind would carry your light to the skies

Lunch just some lettuce two celery stalks no booze no potatoes no ham
Dinner one chicken wing broiled not fried no gravy no biscuits no pie
And this dietin dietin dietin dietin sure is a rough way to die
So pass me a carrot stick peel me a prune a glass of skim milk and thats all
Turn off the TV for the Big Mac commercial its drivin me straight up the wall
And Im think of french fries sausage and waffles spaghetti and cookies and cake
And each night Im dreamin of chocolate ice cream and
Im starvin to death when I wake all for your sake
Youre fixin the kids all those creamed mashed potatoes
But its bouillon and water for me and you got a lock on the refrigerator
Lord knows where youre hidin the key
And while I am starvin for food late at night Im starvin for lovin from you
But you say that when I can see my own dick youll be glad to look at it too

And put down that candy bar while I am singin Im starvin my ass off for you
And when I am dead with the insurance paid youll look down at me and youll grin
Youll say well the boy tried and he suffered and died
But dont he look good when hes thin
Where did you get such a dirty face
My darling dirtyfaced child
I got it from crawling along in the dirt
And biting two buttons off Jeremys shirt
I got it from chewing the roots of a rose
And digging for clams in the yard with my nose
I got it from peeking into a dark cave
And painting myself like a Navajo brave
I got it from playing with coal in the bin
And signing my name in cement with my chin
I got if from rolling around on the rug
And giving the horrible dog a big hug
I got it from finding a lost silver mine
And eating sweet blackberries right off the vine
I got it from ice cream and wrestling and tears
And from having more fun than youve had in years
Well I was sittin up in my crane leftin boulders in the rain
Cant get promoted no matter what I do
Ah when the forman he comes around and he yells up from the ground
He says hold that load up there for a minute or two
Cause I got to check some gear down here below
So whatever you do with them rocks just dont let go
Just dont let go just dont let go
Sittin by his desk drinkin coffee it seems that he got hit by a rock or three
Theyre puttin my name on the door where his name was before
Oh dirty ol me say dirty ol me
Now my best friend had confessed that his life had been a mess
Yeah when he was young he robbed the bank and then ran
But now he lives an honest life and hes got a lovely wife
But still it hurts to be a wanted man
But he said nobody knows about it but my friends and kin
And I know a none of them would ever turn me in
Theyd never turn me in theyd never turn me in
Im slouchin on his couch drinkin his whiskey
Well it seems somebody called the police on he
And between the hugs and kisses that Im gettin from his Mrs
I think oh dirty ol me dirty ol me
And then of course it follows I found a suitcase full of dollars
About fifteen thousand of em more or less
And inside there was a note that some poor old lady wrote
Givin me her name and her address
And it said if lost finder please return without hesitation
Cause Ive been savin this money for fifteen years
Strippin and sufferin and takin in washin
Scrubbin floors and sellin flowers in the snow
And now I need it for a serious operation a serious operation a serious operation
Now Im layin on the beach in Acapulco got enough money to last till Im ninetythree
And Im eatin enchilidas served by lovely signoritas
Thinkin oh dirty ol me thinkin dirty ol me

Yknow and that old lady yknow if there was such an old lady

But if there was she she can get MediCare theyve got

Don’t give a dose to the one you love most
Give her some marmaladegive her some toast
You can give her the willies or give her the blues
But the dose that you give her will get back to youse
I once had a lady as sweet as a song
She was my darlin’ and she was my dear
But she had a dose and she passed it along
Now she’s gone but the dose is still there
So don’t give a dose to the one you love most
Give her some marmaladegive her some toast
You can give her a partiridge up in a pear tree
But the dose that you give her might get back to me
So if you’ve got an itchin’if you’ve got a drip
Don’t sit there wishin’ for it to go ’way
If there’s a thing on the tip of your thing or your lip
Run down to the clinic today and say
I won’t give a dose to the one I love most
I’ll give her some marmaladegive her some toast
Give her the willies or give her the blues
But the dose that you give her will get back to you
Would you like to buy a dog with a tail at either end
He is quite the strangest dog there is in town
Though hes not too good at knowing
just exactly where hes going
He is very very good at sitting down
He doesnt have a place to put a collar
And Ill admit its rather hard to lead him
And he cannot hear you call
For he has no ears at all
But it doesnt cost a single cent to feed him
He cannot bite hell never bark or growl
Just scratch him on his tails hell find it pleasing
But youll have to take him out
For twice as many walks
And Ill bet that you can quickly guess the reason
Unwind my mind oh baby drain my brain
Unscrew my head take a part of my heart
Scrape away the pain and start all over again
I tell you baby I dont understand just how you can make love to me
While youre lookin at the picture of another man
You got me talkin to my elbow climbin up the wall
First you tell me you despise me then you say you idolize me
Then you tell me you cant use me at all
Unwind my mind
guitar
Unwind my mind
I tell you baby I just cant go on
The hung up way that were livin while Im doin all the givin
You keep on callin me John
First you messin with Charlie and then you jivin with Jim
And I know you need a father but I really cant bother
Bein all those other guys plus him
Unwind my mind
Unwind my mind settle my spine yeah unroll my soul yeah
Someone ate the baby
Its rather sad to say
Someone ate the baby
So she wont be out to play
Well never hear her whiney cry
Or have to feel if she is dry
Well never hear her asking Why
Someone ate the baby
Someone ate the baby
Its absolutely clear
Someone ate the baby
Cause the baby isnt here
Well give away her toys and clothes
Well never have to wipe her nose
Dad says Thats the way it goes
Someone ate the baby
Someone ate the baby
What a frightful thing to eat
Someone ate the baby
Though she wasnt very sweet
It was a heartless thing to do
The policemen havent got a clue
I simply cant imagine who
Would go and burp eat the baby

I went to the doctor
He reached down my throat
He pulled out a shoe
And a little toy boat
He pulled out a skate
And a bicycle seat
And said Be more careful
About what you eat
Okay now years ago I wrote a song called A Boy Named Sue and that was okay
And everything except then I started to think about it and I thought
It is unfair I am looking at the whole thing from the poor kids point of view
And as I get more older and more fatherly
I begin to look at things from an old mans point of view
So I decided to give the old man equal time okay here we go
Yeah I lef home when the kid was three and it sure felt good to be fancy free
Tho I knew it wasnt quite the fatherly thing to do
But that kid kept screamin and throwin up and pissin in his pants til I had enough
So just for revenge I went and named him Sue
Yeah it was Gatlinberg in mid July I was gettin drunk but gettin by
Gettin old and goin from bad to worse
When thru the door with an awful scream comes the ugliest queen Ive ever seen
He says my name is Sue how do you do then he hits me with his purse
Now this aint the way he tells the tale but he scratched my face with his fingernails
And then he bit my thumb and kicked me with his highheeled shoe
So I hit him in the nose and he started to cry and he threw some perfume in my eye
And it sure aint easy fightin with a boy named Sue
So I hit him in the head with a canedback chair
And he screamed hey dad you mussed my hair
And he hit me in the navel and knocked out a piece of my lint
He was spittin blood I was spittin teeth
And we crashed through the wall and out into the street
A kickin and gougin in the mud and the blood and the creme de menth
Then out of his garter he pulls a gun Im about to get shot by my very own son
Hes screamin bout Sigmond Freud and lookin grim uh
So I thought fast and I told him some stuff
How I named him Sue just to make him tough
And I guess he bought it cuz now Im livin with him
Yeah he cooks and sews and cleans up the place he cuts my hair and shaves my face
And irons my shirts better than a daughter could do
And on the nights that I cant score well I cant tell you anymore
Sure is a joy to have a boy named Sue yeah a son is fun
But its a joy to have a boy named Sue
As I walk down to Bishop Street I met a girl who smiled so sweet
Now she was young and pretty too
And on a string she walked with a thing called the Floobie Doobie Doo
Oh the Floobie Doobie Doo now what is that it aint no dog and it aint no cat
Its not the doll with eyes of blue
I never seen such a thing as thing called the Floobie Doobie Doo
It had one tooth five purple toes sixteen elbows and a twelvefoot nose
You never see one in the Zoo
I mean a thing like a thing on a string called the Floobie Doobie Doo
I told that girl lemme take you home and maybe we can be alone hahaha
She said Id love to go home with you
But I have to cling to my thing on the string called the Floobie Doobie Doo
Well I took her home that very night we talked a while and I dimmed the light
She cuddled close and the next thing I knew
Just as soon as it seen us in between us jumped the Floobie Doobie Doo
It stayed all night it stayed all year I never got to hold you near
I said sweet baby I wanna cling to you
But she wanna cling to the thing on the string called the Floobie Doobie Doo
Oh the Floobie Doobie Doo oh now what is that
It aint no dog it aint no cow it aint no cat
Its not the doll with eyes of blue
You just cant swing with the thing on the string called the Floobie Doobie Doo
Well she cried and cried she wiped her eye she said farewell so long goodbye
For though I loved you yes I do
I cant reveal the love that I feel for the Floobie Doobie Doo
I never see her anymore she never knocks upon my door
And every night alone and blue
I sit and swing about a swing on a thing
I mean I sit and think about a swing on a thing
I mean I sit and sing about a thing on a string called the Floobie Doobie Doo oooh
Well Id like to sing a song about the chain gang
And swingin twelve pound hammers all the day
And how a Id like to kill my captain
And how a black man works his life away but
What do you do if youre young and white and Jewish
And youve never swung a hammer against a spike
And youve never called a water boy
Early in the morning
And your only chain is the chain thats on your bike Yes
Your only chain is the chain on your bike
Now Id like to go awalkin up the highway
Feelin cold and wet and hungry all night long
Doin some hard ramblin hard gamblin hard smamblin hard blamblin
But always takin time to write a song But
What do you do if youre young and white and Jewish
And you never heard an old freight whistle blow
And youve never slept the night
In a cold and empty box car
And you take a subway everywhere you go Oh oh
You take the subway everywhere you go
Now Id like to sing a song about the coal mine
Achippin away in tunnel 22
And when I hear that timber crack why I support it with my back
Until my comrades all crawl safely through but
What do you do if youre young and white and Jewish
And youve got to be in class at halfpast nine
And in spite of all your urgin and your pleadin and your cryin
Your mother says its too dirty down in a mine That what she says
Your mother says its too dirty down in a mine
Well now Id like to sing about the Mississippi
Workin on the levee all the day
And when them cotton bolls get rotten
You got a lotta rotten cotton
And on Saturday you go and spend your pay but
What do you do if youre young and white and Jewish
And youve never loaded cotton on the dock
And youve never worked a day
Or drunk up all your pay
And the only levee you know is the Levy who lives on the block Yes
The only levee you know is the Levy who lives on the block
One sister for sale
One sister for sale
One crying and spying young sister for sale
I’m really not kidding
So who’ll start the bidding
Do I hear the dollar
A nickel
A penny
Oh isn’t there isn’t there isn’t there any
One kid that will buy this old sister for sale
This crying and spying young sister for sale
She had to die
This Omoo knew
He also knew he could not kill her
Not even try to kill her
Those eyes Would look at him Not even try
So what to do
There was one Ung Who lived in a cave
Beyond the hard mountain A foul cave
Far from the village
Ung who hunted with stones
Who killed with his hands
Who had killed two sabertooths
And one great bear whose skin he now wore hanging from his hairy shoulders
And Ung had killed men Many men
And it was said a woman
Ung who took the fresh meat left upon the flat rock for the Spirit of the Sky
And the Spirit of the Sky would go hungry
And bring pain and darkness to the village
But none dare say words to Ung
Who had killed two sabertooths
And one great bear And men many men
And it was said a woman
He went to Ung
Yes said Ung I will kill her
For what she has done said Omoo
For equal weight said Ung in bear meat or lizard skins
She is a large woman said Omoo
Equal wait said Ung Now you must come and show her to me that I may kill her
I cannot said Omoo
Then how will I know her
Her hair is long said Omoo
Her eyes burn like the pools of night
Many have the long hair said Ung
Many have eyes like the pool of night
She will be bathing said Omoo
Tomorrow as the sun dies
She will be bathing Washing her long hair at the falling water
Many women will be bathing said Ung
Many longhaired nighteyed women
How will I know it is she
Omoo thought
Ah he said she will be carrying flowers
Bright hill flowers that I shall gather and place in her hands before she goes to bathe at the falling water
Then you will know her
Then you will kill her
For equal weight said Ung
Yes said Omoo for equal weight
And so was begun the custom
Of giving bouquets and corsages
Once I spoke the language of the flowers
Once I understood each word the caterpillar said
Once I smiled in secret at the gossip of the starlings
And shared a conversation with the housefly
in my bed
Once I heard and answered all the questions
of the crickets
And joined the crying of each falling dying
flake of snow
Once I spoke the language of the flowers
How did it go
How did it go
Come on baby grease your lips
Put on your hat and shake your hips
And don’t forget to bring your ships
We’re goin’ to the Freakers Ball
Shake your mojo bang your gong
Roll up somethin’ to take along
Feels so good that it must be wrong
Freakin’ at the Freakers Ball
All the fags and dykes they’re boogyin’ together
Leather freaks all dressed in leather
The greatest of the sadists and the masochists too
Screamin’ You hit me and I’ll hit you
FBI dancin’ with the junkies
All the straights swingin’ with the funkies
’Cross the floor and up the wall
Freakin’ at the Freakers Ball
Hard hats and long hairs lovin’ each other
Brother with sister son with mother
Smear my body up with butter
Take me to the Freakers Ball
So pass that roach pour the wine
I’ll kiss yours and you’ll kiss mine
I’m gonna boogie til I go blind
Freakin’ at the Freakers Ball

Hector the Collector
Collected bits of string
Collected dolls with broken heads
And rusty bells that would not ring Bentup nails and icecream sticks
Twists of wires wornout tires
Paper bags and broken bricks
Old chipped vases half shoelaces
Gatlin guns that wouldnt shoot
Leaky boasts that wouldnt float
And stoppedup horns that wouldnt toot Butter knives that had no handles
Copper keys that fit no locks
Rings that were too small for fingers
Driedup leaves and patchedup socks
Wornout belts that had no buckles
Lectric trains that had no tracks
Airplane models broken bottles
Threelegged chairs and cups with cracks
Hector the Collector
Loved these things with all his soul
Loved them more then shining diamonds
Loved them more then glistenin gold
Hector called to all the people
Come and share my treasure trunk
And all the silly sightless people
Came and looked and called it junk
Agatha Fry she made a pie
And Christopher John helped bake it
Christopher John he mowed the lawn
And Agatha Fry helped rake it
Now Zachary Zugg took out the rug
And Jennifer Joy helped shake it
Then Jennifer Joy she made a toy
And Zachary Zugg helped break it
And some kind of help is the kind of help
That helpings all about
And some kind of help is the kind of help
We all can do without
Hey Nelly Nelly come to the window
Hey Nelly Nelly look at what I see
Hes riding into town on a sway back mule
Got a tall black hat and he looks like a fool
He sure is talkin like hes been to school
And its 1853
Hey Nelly Nelly listen what hes sayin
Hey Nelly Nelly he says its gettin late
And he says them black folks should all be free
To walk around the same as you and me
Hes talkin bout a thing he calls democracy
And its 1858
Hey Nelly Nelly hear the band a playing
Hey Nelly Nelly hand me down my gun
Cause the men are cheerin and the boys are too
Theyre all puttin on their coats of blue
I cant sit around here and talk to you
Cause its 1861
Hey Nelly Nelly Come to the window
Hey Nelly Nelly Ive come back alive
My coat of blue is stained with red
And the man in the tall black hat is dead
We sure will remember all the things he said
In 1865
Hey Nelly Nelly come to the window
Hey Nelly Nelly look at what I see
I see white folks and colored walkin side by side
Theyre walkin in a column thats a century wide
Its still a long and a hard and a bloody ride
In 1963
There once was a hippo who wanted to fly
Flyhidee tryhidee myhideeho

With the clouds high above and the sea down below
Wherehidee therehidee scarehideeboo
Happy ending
And he flipped and he flapped and he bellowed so loud
Nowhidee loudhidee proudhideepoop
And he sailed like an eagle off into the clouds
Highhidee flyhidee byehideeboop
Unhappy ending
And he leaped like a frog and he fell like a stone
Stonehidee lonehidee ownhideeflop
And he crashed and he drowned and broke all his bones
Boneshidee moanshidee groanshideeglop
Chicken ending
He looked up at the sky and looked down at the sea
Seahidee freehidee wheehideeway
And he turned and went home and had cookies and tea

Depends how thin you cut it
How much good inside a day
Depends how good you live em
How much love inside a friend
Depends how much you give em
Hungry Mungry sat at supper
Took his knife and spoon and fork
Ate a bowl of mushroom soup ate a slice of roasted pork
Ate a dozen stewed tomatoes twentyseven deviled eggs
Fifteen shrimps nine bakes potatoes
Thirtytwo fried chicken legs
A shank of lamb a boiled ham
Two bowls of grits some blackeye peas
Four chocolate shakes eight angel cakes
Nine custard pies with Muenster cheese
Ten pots of tea and after he
Had eaten all that he was able
He poured some broth on the tablecloth
And ate the kitchen table
His parents said Oh Hungry Mungry stop these silly jokes
Mungry opened up his mouth and Gulp he ate his folks
And then he went and ate his house all the bricks and wood
And then he ate up all the people in the neighborhood
Up came twenty angry policeman shouting Stop and cease
Mungry opened his mouth and Gulp he ate the police
Soldiers came with tanks and guns
Said Mungry They cant harm me
He just smiled and licked his lips and ate the US Army
The President sent all his bombers Mungry still was calm
Put his head back gulped the planes and gobbled up the bomb
He ate his town and ate the city ate and ate and
And then he said I think Ill eat the whole United States
And so he ate Chicago first and munched the Water Tower
And then he chewed on Pittsburgh but he found it rather sour
He ate New York and Tennessee and all of Boston town
Then drank the Mississippi River just to wash it down
And when hed eaten every state each puppy boy and girl
He wiped his mouth upon his sleeve and went to eat the world
He ate the Egypt pyramids and every church in Rome
And all the grass in Africa and all in ice in Nome
He ate each hill in green Brazil and then to make things worse
He decided for dessert hed eat the universe
He started with the moon and stars and soon as he was done
He gulped the clouds he sipped the wind and gobbled up the sun
Then sitting there in the cold dark air
He started to nibble his feet
Then his legs then his hips
Then his neck then his lips
Till he sat there just gnashin his teeth
Cause nothin was nothin was
Nothin was nothin was
Nothin was left to eat
You gotta wake up every mornin tip toe in the
kitchen cook me great Tbone steak

chickies when they get out
They should look me up too
And I call that true love
Some guy accuses me of foolin with his wife
and threatens to tear me apart
Points a gun at me I want you to jump in the middle
and take the bullet in your own heart
And as youre lyin on the floor and dyin I want
you to look up at me and say

No I cant touch the clouds for you Ive never reached the sun for you
Ive never done the things that you need done for you
Ive stretched as high as I can reach I guess Im not the one for you
Cause I cant touch the clouds or reach the sun for you
No I cant reach the clouds or touch the sun
No I cant turn back time for you and make you sweet sixteen again
I cant turn your barren fields to green again
And I cant sit around and talk of how might have been again
No I cant turn back time and make you young again
I cant turn back time and make you young
I cant look inside your mind and see the things youre hopin for
I cant help you chase the dream youre gropin for
I know your heart is open wide but I dont know who its open for
Cause I cant know your mind or chase your dreams for you
Mhm I cant chase your dreams or know your mind
So say goodbye and dont look back Ive had some happy days with you
Im sorry but I cant be the one who stays with you
And if they ask about me you can say I was the one with you
Who never touched the clouds or reached the sun with you
I cant touch the clouds or reach the sun for you
I cant touch the clouds or reach the sun
I was sitting in my basement
I just rolled myself a taste
of something green and gold and glorious
to get me through the day
Then my friend yelled through the transom
Grab your coat and get your hat son
Theres a nut down on the corner
givin dollar bills away
But I laid around a bit
Then I had another hit
Then I rolled myself a bauma
Then I thought about my mama
Then I fooled around played around
jacked around a while and then
I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned and it rolled right by
I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned oh me oh my
It took seven months of eargin
just to get that local virgin
with the sweet face
up to my place
to fool around a bit
Next day she woke up rosy
and she snuggled up so cosy
When she asked me how I liked it
Lord it hurts me to admit
I was stoned
Im makin no excuses
for the many things I uses
just to sweeten up my relationships
and brighten up my day
When my earthly race is over
and Im ready for the clover
and they ask me how my life has been
I guess Ill have to say
I was stoned
I know you little I love you lots
my love for you could fill ten pots
fifteen buckets sixteen cans
three teacups and four dishpans
Now Im warnin all you women dont stand too close to me cause you might catch fire
Now youre talkin to a man in a whole other kind of bag
Well Im three parts tiger and one part snake
Ill ball you to sleep and Ill bite you awake
And Im so good that I dont have to brag

Now compared to me Paul Bunyan is a screamin fag
I can shift more gears and pump more juice Ill turn you every which way but loose
And Im so damn good that I dont have to brag
Now theres twenty thirty beautiful women a sleepin at the foot of my bed
And every night every night I hear em sighin
They say that I dont miss a thing they say that Im the lovin king
And Im too nice a guy to say theyre lyin
Now Ive been makin love professionally since I was only six years old
And I really learned the way to wiggly wag
And still Im such a modest man you know Im twice as great as I think I am
Im so good that I dont have to brag
Theres a line of chicks startin at my window and reachin across the street
And it stretches way to the other side of town
They come to me from across the seas on their knees just sayin Please
And Im too nice a guy to turn em down
Now I once got captured by some Amazon women down in the Fiji Isles
They were fightin over me to see whod be my bride
I had to kill them all and I will admit it and I wont tell you how I did it
But Ill tell you each one was smilin when she died
Now the day I die every woman in the countrys gonna go around dressed in black
And theyll probably add another star to the American flag
And theyll build me a monument forty feet high sayin its a shame he had to die
He was so damn good he never had to brag
And Im tellin you men keep your eighteen year old daughters off of my back
And your wives they like the way I carry on
And why dont you go look at your mother for a while
You notice shes wearin a funny sorta smile
Well that just means Ive been there and Ive gone
Now if you got a frigid woman Im gonna cure her for a hundred dollars
You can bring her around my house at four oclock
And you can come and pick her up at 403 if you can pry her off of me
I got a whole lot of others just waitin round the block
Now if youre wonderin how youre gonna get to me
Better bring a Cadillac full of money
Cause I sure as hell aint gonna swing without no swag

And Im so good that I dont have to brag
So Baby dont call me up at three oclock in the mornin no more threatenin suicide

Hmm come to think of it those eyes were blue or were they green
Hmm I wonder if shes still around hmm you know Im really not to blame
Oh I still dont remember her name
Ive been working so hard you just wouldnt believe
And Im tired
Theres so little time and so much to achieve
And Im tired
Ive been lying here holding the grass in its place
Pressing a leaf with the side of my face
Tasting the apples to see if theyre sweet
Counting the toes on a centipedes feet
Ive been memorizing the shape of that cloud
Warning the robins to not chirp so loud
Shooing the butterflies off the tomatoes
Keeping an eye out for floods and tornadoes
Ive been supervising the work of the ants
And thinking of pruning the cantaloupe plants
Calling the fish to swim into my nets
And Ive taken twelve thousand and fortyone breaths
And Im TIRED
Ickle Me Pickle Me Tickle Me too
Went for a ride in a flying shoe
Hooray
What fun
Its time we flew
Said Ickle Me Pickle Me Tickle Me too
Ickle was captain Pickle was crew
And Tickle served coffee and mulligan stew
As higher
And higher
And higher they flew
Ickle Me Pickle Me Tickle Me too
Ickle Me Pickle Me Tickle Me too
Over the sun and beyond the blue 
Hold on
Stay in
I hope we do
Cried Ickle Me Pickle Me Tickle Me too
Ickle Me Pickle Me Tickle Me too
Never returned to the world they knew
And nobody
knows whats
happened to
Dear Ickle Me Pickle Me Tickle Me too
If I had a brontosaurus
I would name him Morris or Horace
But if suddenly one day he had a lot of little brontosauri
I would change his name to Laurie
If the world was crazy you know what Id eat
A big slice of soup and a whole quart of meat
A lemonade sandwich and then I might try
Some roasted ice cream or a bicycle pie
A nice notebook salad and underwear roast
An omelet of hats and some crisp cardboard toast
A thick malted milk made from pencils and daisies
And thats what Id eat if the world was crazy
If the world was crazy you know what Id wear
A chocolate suit and a tie of eclair
Some marshmallow earmuffs some licorice shoes
And Id read a paper of peppermint news
Id call the boys Suzy and Id call the girls Harry
Id talk through my ears and I always would carry
A paper unbrella for when it grew hazy
To keep in the rain if the world was crazy
If the world was crazy you know what Id do
Id walk on the ocean and swim in my shoe
Id fly through the ground and Id skip through the air
Id run down the bathtub and bathe on the stair
When I met somebody Id say Gbye Joe
And when I was leaving then Id say Hello
And the greatest of men would be silly and lazy
So I would be king if the world was cazy
From dusk to dawn
From town to town
Without a single clue
I seek the tender slender foot
To fit this crystal shoe
From dusk to dawn
I try it on
Each damsel that I meet
And I still love her so but oh
Ive started hating feet
Have you seen Amanda Blaine in the hills of Shiloh
Wandering through the morning rain through the hills of Shiloh
Have you seen her at her door listening for the cannons roar
And a man who went to war from the hills of Shiloh
Have you heard her mournful cries in the hills of Shiloh
Have you seen her haunted eyes in the hills of Shiloh
Have you seen her running down searching through the sleeping
town
In her yellowed wedding gown in the hills of Shiloh
Have you seen her standing there in the hills of Shiloh
Wind a blowing through her hair in the hills of Shiloh
Listening for the sound of guns listening for the rolling drums
And a man who never comes to the hills of Shiloh
Have you heard Amanda sing in the hills of Shiloh
Whispering to her wedding ring in the hills of Shiloh
Hear her humming soft and low poor Amanda doesnt know
Twas ended forty years ago in the hills of Shiloh
If you are a dreamer come in
If you are a dreamer a wisher a liar
A hopeer a prayer a magic bean buyer
If youre a pretender come sit by the fire
For we have some flaxgolden tales to spin
Come in
Come in
I am writing these poems
From inside a lion
And its rather dark in here
So please excuse the handwriting
Which may not be too clear
But this afternoon by the lions cage
Im afraid I got too near
And Im writing these lines
From inside a lion
And its rather dark in here
Ill tell you the story of Jimmy Jet
And you know what I tell you is true
He loved to watch his TV set
Almost as much as you
He watched all day he watched all night
Till he grew pale and lean
From The Early Show to The Late Show
And all the shows in between
He watched till his eyes were frozen wide
And his bottom grew into his chair
And his chin turned into a tuning dial
And antennae grew out of his hair
And his brains turned into TV tubes
And his face to a TV screen
And two knobs saying vert and horiz
Grew where his ears had been
And he grew a plug that looked like a tail
So we plugged in little Jim
And now instead of him watching TV
We all sit around and watch him
Joey Joey took a stone
And knocked
Down
The
Sun
And Whoosh It swizzled
Down so hard
And bloomp It bounced
In his backyard
And glunk It landed
On his toe
And the world was dark
And the corn wouldn’t grow
And the wind wouldn’t blow
And the bleep wouldn’t crow
And it always was Night
Night
Night
All because
Of a stone
And Joe
The waitress with the orange hair keeps motionin me to hurry up and leave
I gulp my coffee burn my mouth grab up my coat and slippin out
I smear a streak of mustard down my sleeve
And the guy behind the register takes my bread and shakes his head
And looks at me as if Ive blown his mind
Hey I just come here for some coffee…hope Im not waistin anybodys time
And Judy Im slowly movin back to you
And I wish that I could say Ill treat you better than I used to
Its just Im learnin lots of things I never knew back then
Judy Im slowly movin back again
That blue eyed barracuda smiles and tells me she could she could use some brand new clothes
She grabs my leg with a wink asks if I want another drink
Shes not the campfire girl you might suppose
But shes so busy tellin me her troubles I dont think shes got time
For any kind of trouble small as mine
Hey I just come here for nothin… hope Im not waistin anybodys time
I stop here on the corner but that red faced cop says move along your way
My toes are cold my nose is numb I got no feeling in my thumb
I think I just might stop inside that church and maybe pray
But they pass the plate and look at me when it turns out that I aint got a dime
Hey I just come in here to talk to GOD… hope Im not waistin anybodys time
So you heard there was a spark of love that I have for you
You come back to kill it like you always do
You found it weak and tremblin hangin on just by a thread
And you kicked it choke it stepped on it and broke it left it half to death
Kick it again its still breathing
Kick it again I think I seen it move just a little bitty
Kick it again its still living
So kick it again and then again and then youll kill my love for you
harmonica guitar
Youre gonna have to do much more this time than amake it crawl
A cheatin on it doesnt seem to work at all
And it wont do no good to try to shame it to death
Cause its raspin gaspin crawlin callin to you with each dying breath
Kick it again its still breathing
There´s a shadow on the sun I see it risin´
Kiss it away Kiss it away
And there´s hurt down deep inside that I been hidin´
Kiss it away Kiss it away
All the hard times we been through
We´d never mind them
We´d kiss ´em away we´d just kiss ´em away
But now I´m lookin for the good times and I can´t find them
Guess we kissed them away Must have kissed them away
Kiss away I keep thinkin´ the sun will shine once more
I´m never ready for the sudden rain
Don´t tell me I´m wrong ´cause I been told
I feel so wet and cold
Come my pain
You keep hopin´ things´ll change and I keep tryin´
One of these days maybe one of these days
But there´s a coldness in the air like somethin´ dyin
Kiss it away Come and kiss it away
Pamela Purse yelled Ladies first
Pushing in front of the ice cream line
Pamela Purse yelled Ladies first
Grabbing the ketchup at dinnertime
Climbing on the morning bus
Shed shove right by all of us
And thered be a tiff or a fight or a fuss
When Pamela Purse yelled Ladies first
Pamela Purse screamed Ladies first
When we went off on our jungle trip
Pamela Purse said her thirst was worse
And guzzled our water every sip
And when we got grabbed by that wild savage band
Who tied us together and made us all stand
In a long line in front of the King of the land
A cannibal known as FryEmUp Dan
Who sat on his throne in a bib so grand
With a lick of his lips and a fork in his hand
As he tried to decide whod be first in the pan
From back of the line in that shrill voice of hers
Pamela Purse yelled Ladies first
Hey Lady Godiva ridin´ through the town
Naked on your big white horse
With your long hair hangin´ down
Lady Godiva you say you´re really frightened
and so shy
I hate to bust your bubble but you
Sure picked a funny place to hide
Hey Lady Godiva lookin´ for a place
Where no one wants your body
And nobody knows your face
Lady Godiva you say you wanna be loved
For what´s inside
I don´t know much about horses but you
Sure picked a funny place to ride
Every man´s just a clutchin´ hand
Reachin´ out to grab you
Every man´s a quiverin´ lance
Tryin´ hard to stab you don´t let ´em nab you
Hey Lady Godiva lookin´ kind of scared
You showed ´em all your talents
But nobody seems to care
Lady Godiva could it be nobody wants to ride
Come to think it over
You may have picked the perfect place to hide
Lazy

She’s a liberated lady and she’s lookin’ out for herself
And she don’t need your protection
And she does not want your help
And if you’re lookin’ for some pretty flower
You better go look somewhere else
’Cause I warn you she’s a liberated lady
She got off work at the foundry she was feelin’ kind of beat
On the bus she had to stand and let some fella have her seat
And she pinched the ass of a guy who passed her
Walkin’ down the street
When he called a cop she didn’t quite understand
So she stopped off on the corner for her usual shot of rye
When some guy lit her cigarette she punched him in the eye
Then he kicked her in the balls it was enough to make her cry
But she stood there and she took it like a man
She’s a liberated lady and she smokes them big cigars
You’re gonna find her drinkin’ boilermakers at the corner bar
And in 30 seconds flat she’ll change a flat tire on your car
Look out –– she’s a liberated lady
She come home to find her darlin’ husband cryin’ in distress
She said Why ain’t supper ready and why is this house a mess
He said The kids have drove me crazy and I need a brand–new dress
And how come you don’t ever take me dancin’
She sat down to smoke her pipe and she thought back to the time
When she was satin silk and lace with nothing on her mind
But now she’s gotta mow the lawn and pay the bills on time
And pray to Mrs God she don’t get drafted
They got into bed that evening and she strapped her dildo on
She climbed on top of him and said Ok let’s get it on
He said You know I’ve got my period and my headache isn’t gone 
And he fell asleep –– the chauvinistic bastard
But she’s a liberated lady and she smokes them big cigars
You’re gonna find her drinkin’ boilermakers at the corner bar
And in 30 seconds flat she’ll change a flat tire on your car
Look out –– she’s a liberated lady
Listen to Mustnts child listen to the Donts

There was a girl named Abigail
Who was taking a drive
Through the country
With her parents
When she spied a beautiful sadeyed
Grey and white pony
And next to it was a sign
That said
FOR SALECHEAP
“Oh” said Abigail
“May I have that pony
May I please ”
And her parents said
“No you may not”
And Abigail said
“But I MUST have that pony”
And her parents said
Well you cant have that pony
“Well you can have a nice butter pecan
Ice cream cone when we get home”
And Abigail said
“I don’t want a butter pecan
Ice cream cone
I WANT THAT PONY
I MUST HAVE THAT PONY”
And her parents said
“Be quiet and stop nagging
You’re not getting that pony”
And Abigail began to cry and said
“If I don’t get that pony I’ll die”
And her parents said “You won’t die
No child ever died yet from not getting a pony”
And Abigail felt so bad
That when she got home she went to bed
And she couldn’t eat
And she couldn’t sleep
And her heart was broken
And she DID die
All because of a pony
That her parents wouldn’t buy
The honeymoon ended a decade ago
If he still loves her he dont say so
So shes taking her blues to the House af Tattoos
Getting little green buttons on her birthday suit
Little green buttons all in a row
From her face to the place they aint never gonna slow
Might sound crazy but they sure look cute
Those little green buttons on her birthday suit
She had supper in the oven when he came home
Now hes snoring on the sofa to the Late Late Show
It was ten days later before he knew
Bout those little green buttons on her birthday suit
But now shes living in a house of love
Shes got his attention he cant get enough
He spends every evening trying to undo
The little green buttons on her birthday suit
You may be lookin for me but I aint lookin for you
Im still lookin for myself and I aint got time to look for nobody else
When I found who I am and where I am
And if you come round again maybe then baby maybe then
You wanna follow me but honey cant you see
I dont know where the hell Im goin
How can I know your mind when I dont even know my own
Now when the road gets tough or when I get enough
Or maybe when I reach the end maybe then baby maybe then
So stick around or go away whichever one you choose
You aint got a single thing that I think I can use
And you and I aint shared a thing that Im afraid to lose
You say that you love me but I dont love you
I love someone I never seen as she lives in a place that I never been
When I realize its all in my eyes
Just one great big patent maybe then maybe then
Maybe then maybe then maybe then but I wont say when
Maybe then baby maybe then
Mama said Id lose my head
If it wasnt fastened on
Today I guess it wasnt
Cause while playing with my cousin
It fell off and rolled away
And now its gone
And I cant look for it
Cause my eyes are in it
And I cant call to it
Cause my mouth is on it
Couldnt hear me anyway
Cause my ears are on it
Cant even think about it
Cause my brain is in it
So I guess Ill sit down
On this rock
And rest for just a minute…
Ricky was L but hes home with the flu
Lizzie our O had some homework to do
Mitchell E probly got lost on the way
So Im all of love that could make it today

For the record Lydia Pinkhams Medicinal Compound
was a concoction sold in drugstores some years ago
which was about 97 alcohol and advertized itself
as being able to cure practically anything I believe
this song was written by Shel Silverstein
Sandras seen a leprechaun
Eddie touched a troll
Laurie danced with witches once
Charlie found some goblins gold
Donald heard a mermaid sing
Susy spied an elf
But all the magic I have known
Ive had to make myself
She wouldnt believe
This pencil has
A magical eraser
She said I was a silly moo
She said I was a liar too
She dared me prove that it was true
And so what could I do
I erased her
Im gonna throw my grass out the window
Crumple up my papers too
Give away my speed Cause all Im gonna need
Is just a little bit of love from you
And well be makin it natural
And aint it just about time
That stuff I was so keen on
I no longer have to lean on
Cause your loves enough to keep me high
Now if any you heads want some Panama red
All you gotta do is to reach out your hand
Ill trade my stash for just about enough cash
To buy a simple golden wedding band
And well be makin it natural
But dont you ask me how
Its been the cause of all my sorrow
But I think Ill start tomorrow
Cause I sure could use a hit right now
But Ill throw it out the window some day
Give away my cocaine
Bust my spikes and flush a million mikes
Of acid right down the drain
And well be makin it natural makin it natural
Ive sung my songs on dusty roads and dirty city sidewalks
To sweatin hard eyed brakemen in the rail yards I rolled through
Ive sung in blue wall papered rooms to girls I played at lovin
Now Mama…Ill sing one song for you
Mama let me tell you that Ive never lost the memry
Of the tender things you told me and the gentle things youd do
And though Ive grown away and other arms reach out to hold me
Mama…Ill sing one song for you
You say youd like to have me here to help you through the winter
But you say it with a wistful smile like you already knew
That your boys no good at stayin still theres no words that need sayin
And Mama… Ill sing one song for you
Tomorrow Ill be movin out on them dusty country backroads
Some sweatin hard eyed brakeman may hear a tune or two
And the girl in the blue wall papered room shell ask where i been hidin
And Ill tell em I stopped and sang one song for you
Koweha Gemini Jim taw Scorpio Salo
Taw sejnonejotokono ohanashitesaw
There was Gemini Jim and Scorpio Sal they was livin by the Golden Gate
Freezin their nose and wearin leather clothes and dealin every way but straight
They had a Leo dog and a Capricorn cat and everything was goin fine
Until into their life on a moonless night come the man who got no sign
He roared right in like some evil wind and he rolled himself a righteous smoke
As the thunder scrashed and the lightenin flashed he took a toke and a spoke
Said he was born in an astrological warp when the stars refused to shine
On the cusp of Nowhere and Nevermore hes the man that got no sign
Then he told a story of an endless search to find his missin part
And Scorpio Sal she smiles at him tries to do his chart
But the Pisces Ben who was Jims best friend aaid man you must be blind
You better grab your knife and take the life of the man whod got no sign
And so it happened and his blood run soaked the ground
The arrest was made by Sheriff Slade and Aquarius thru and thru
But the jailer was a Sagittarius so he beat Jim black and blue
And then they dragged him up to the courthouse stairs they said Jim how do you plea
He said man the moons in Virgo so the blame dont fall on me
Well the jury all was the Libras so you know they was more than fair
But the lawyer was an Aries and an Aries just dont care
The judge he was a Cancer and Cancers have no friends
But the hungman was a Taurus and thats where the circle ends
Down in Lou´siana where the black trees grow
Lives a voodoo lady named Marie Laveaux
She got a black cat tooth and a mojo bone
And anyone wouldn´t leave her alone
She go GREEEEEEEEEEEE
Another man done gone
She live in a swamp in a hollow log
With a oneeyed snake and a threelegged dog
She got a bent bony body and stringy hair
And if she ever seen you messin´ round there
She go GREEEEEEEEEEEE
Another man done gone
And then one night when the moon was black
Into the swamp came Handsome Jack
A nogood man like you all know
And he was lookin´ around for Marie Laveaux
He said Marie Laveau you lovely witch
Why don´t you gimme a little charm that´ll make me rich
Gimme million dollars and I´ll tell you what I´ll do
This very night I´m gonna marry you
It´ll be UMMMMMMMM
Another man done gone
So Marie did some magic and she shook a little sand
Made a million dollars and she put it in his hand
Then she looked and she said Hey hey
I´m gettin´ ready for my wedding day
But ol´ Handsome Jack said Goodbye Marie
You too damn ugly for a man like me
So Marie started shakin´ her fangs started gnashin´
Her body started shakin´ and her eyes started flashin´
She went GREEEEEEEEEEEE
Another man done gone
So if you ever get down where the black tree grow
And meet a voodoo lady named Marie Laveaux
And if she ever asks you to make her your wife
Man you better stay with her for the rest of your life
Or it´ll be GREEEEEEEEEEEE
Another man done gone
Oh ever since my Masochistic Baby went and left me
I got nothin’ to hit but the wall
She loved me when I beat her
But I started actin’ sweeter
And that was no way to treat her at all
Yes she is the one that I’m dreamin’ of
And you always hurt the one you love
And ever since my Masochistic Baby went and left me
I got nothin’ to hit but the wall oh no
Nothin’ to beat but the eggs
Nothin’ to belt but my pants
Nothin’ to whip but the cream
Nothin’ to punch but the clock
Nothin’ to strike but a match
I have nothing to put in my stew you see
Not a bone or a bean or a blackeyed pea
So Ill just climb in the pot to see
If I can make a stew out of me
Ill put in some pepper and salt and Ill sit
In the bubbling waterI wont scream a bit
Ill sing while I simmer Ill smile while Im stewing
Ill taste myself often to see how Im doing
Ill stir me around with this big wooden spoon
And serve myself up at a quarter to noon
So bring out your stew bowls
You gobblers and snackers
Farewelland I hope you enjoy me with crackers
Have you heard of tiny Melinda Mae
Who ate a monstrous whale
She thought she could
She said she would
So she started in right at the tail
And everyone saidYoure much too small
But that didnt bother Melinda at all
She took little bites and she chewed very slow
Just like a little girl should
and eightynine years later she ate that whale
Because she said she would
Hey when I was a lad in fishing town an old man said to me
You can spend your life your jolly life just sailing on the sea
Now you can search the world for pretty girls till your eyes are weak and dim
But dont go swimming with the mermaid son if you dont know how to swim
If you dont know how to swim
For her hair is green as seaweed and her skin is blue and pale
And I tell you now before you start you can love that girl with all your heart
But youre just gonna love the upper part youre not gonna like the tail
So I signed onto a whaling ship and my very first day at sea
I seen a mermaid in the waves reaching out to me
Come live with me in the sea said she and down on the oceans floor
Ill show you a million wonderous things you never seen before
Oh you never seen before
So over I jumped and she pulled me down down to her seaweed bed
And the pillow made of tortoise shell she placed beneath my head
She fed me shrimps and caviar upon the silver dish
From her head to her waist she was my taste but the bottom part was a fish
Oh her bottom part was a fish
Oh her hair were green as seaweed her eyes were blue and pale
And I loved that girl with all my heart I vowed wed never part
But I knew the back was not too smart cause I did not like the tail
And then one day when I looked up I saw a sailin ship
And I met the stare of a millionaire out on a fishing trip
A diamond ring he tied to a string and lowered it down to the water
And my love divine she went for his line and that was the way he caught her
Yes that was the way he caught her
So I sat and cried to the tide same to the clams and whales
How I missed my love her seaweed hair and the silvery shine of her scales
Just then her sister swam on by and set my heart awhirl
For her upper part was an ugly old fish but the bottom part was girl
Yes the bottom part was girl
Yes her knees are pink and rosy and her toes are small and frail
Her body its a work of art and I love that girl with all my heart
And I dont give a damn about the upper part and thats how I end my tale
No ones hangin stockins up
No ones bakin pie
No ones lookin up to see
A new star in the sky
No ones talkin brotherhood
No ones givin gifts
And no one loves a Christmas tree
On March the twentyfifth
Whosever room this is should be ashamed
His underwear is hanging on the lamp
His raincoat is there in the overstuffed chair
And the chair is becoming quite mucky and damp
His workbook is wedged in the window
His sweaters been thrown on the floor
His scarf and one ski are beneath the TV
And his pants have been carelessly hung on the door
His books are all jammed in the closet
His vest has been left in the hall
A lizard named Ed is asleep in his bed
And his smelly old sock has been stuck to the wall
Whosever room this is should be ashamed
Donald or Robert or Willie or
Huh You say its mine Oh dear
I knew it looked familiar
There was a time when people taked said with their mouth
How they talk and it doesnt mean a thing its called the modern talk
Now picture the scene the day is sunny
A man meets a friend and asks him for some money
He says I need five to keep me alive
And the friend gives him this kinda jive
He says zaa za voo za za voo I cant make it
Va za va za voo za va see ya later so long see you later
Vome zoo za vome a viddle o till then
And hes right back out on the street again
And then a girl gets on the phone and talks to her lover
She says we got troubles that we cant keep covered
I just got the news Im knittin baby shoes
Now call up the preacher and pay your dues
He says zaa za voo za za voo see you later so long huhuh
I cant stand baby vome zoo za vome till then
And shes right back out on the street again
And then a guy gets grabbed by an army recruiter
He says were gonna put you in the khaki suiter
So do not cry and dont you lie but take this test to qualify
The guys says blblblblblbl huhuh till then
And hes right back out on the street again
And then a lady goes down to see her psychiatrist
And lies on a couch to give her little head a twist
Now is it a psychosis or is it a neurosis the doctor gives her this diagnosis
Sayin huhuh listen huhuh twenty dollars
Huhh next Wednesday baby then well huhuh then
Shes right back out on the street again
And then the preachers in the church theyre blessin and damnin
Presidents standin there just Vietnamin
While the animals sing and politicians swing
And everybodys sayin the same damned thing
Theyre sauin zaa za voo za za voo you know thats modern talk
Followin’ the trail on the old treasure map
I came to the spot that said “Dig right here”
And four feet down my spade struck wood
Just where the map said a chest would appear
But carved in the side were written these words
“A curse upon he who disturbs this gold”
Signed Morgan the Pirate Scourge of the Seas
I read these words and my blood ran cold
So here I sit upon untold wealth
Tryin’ to figure which is worse
How much do I need this gold
And how much do I need this curse
Everythings wrong
Days are too long
Sunshines too hot
Wind is too strong
Clouds are too fluffy
Grass is too green
Ground is too dusty
Sheets are too clean
Stars are too twinkly
Moon is too high
Waters too drippy
Sand is too dry
Rocks are too heavy
Feathers too light
Kids are too noisy
Shoes are too tight
Folks are too happy
Singin their songs
Why cant they see it
Everythings wrong
My beard grows down to my toes
I never wears no clothes
I wraps my hair
Around my bare
And down the road I goes
Walk into a restaurant with chicken on my mind
Look at the menu I want roastbeaf and wine
A waitress comes up I order baked beans and bread
Oh when she brings it I want hamn eggs instead
Because my mind keeps a movin bouncin and a groovin
A flippin floppin every whichaway
From minute to minute if my mind aint really in it
Never know just what Im do or say
Sometimes I wake up happy sometimes I wake up mean
Sometimes I wake up missin somethin I aint seen
Might wake up wasted and I might wake up dead
Might wake up and look around and jump back into bed
Because my mind keeps a movin
guitar
Sittin home at midnight thinkin bout Marie go to the phone I dial Carol Lee
I say come by babe just as fast as you can
And when she gets there Im thinkin bout Ann
Because my mind keeps a movin
Fly off to Paris just to get away from home
Get off in London and I grab a boat for Rome
Got to St Louis be in St Paul or else take a trip and go no place at all
Because my mind keeps a movin
I go to a psychiatrist to straighten my head
Then I decide I need a chiropractor instead
Put salt in my coffee and ketchup in my tea only dig a chick that dont dig me
Because my mind keeps a movin
Sometimes I dont shave and I look kinda weird
So shave off my hair and I grow a beard
Shave off my beard dye my eyebrows green
Play myself a song upon a tambourine
Because my mind keeps a movin
If you want to marry me heres what youll have to do
You must learn how to make a perfect chickendumpling stew
And you must sew my holey socks
And soothe my troubled mind
And develop the knack for scratching my back
And keep my shoes spotlessly shined
And while I rest you must rake up the leaves
And when it is hailing and snowing
You must shovel the walk and be still when I talk
And hey where are you going
Never bite a married woman on the thigh oh my
Cause she just cant rub it off no matter how shell try
And when she gets home at night her man will ask her why
Then shell say its just a birthmark or some other silly lie
But hell get suspicious and then he will start to pry
Then shell get hysterical and she will start to cry
And hell say I dont blame you but tell me whos the guy
So shell admit to everything and he will say byebye
And hell buy an airline ticket and hell fly across the sky
And then hell come and find you and hell punch you in the eye
Then hell rent a cheap hotel room and hell hang himself with his tie
And when she gets the news shell take an overdose of sleeping
Tablets and shes gonna lie on the couch and die
So never never never never never never never bite a married woman on the thigh
Small as a peanut
Big as a giant
Were all the same size
When we turn off the light
Rich as a sultan
Poor as a mite
Were all worth the same
When we turn off the light
Red black or orange
Yellow or white
We all look the same
When we turn off the light
So maybe the way
To make everything right
Is for God to just reach out
And turn off the light
No I do not want a kitten
No cute cuddly kittypoo
No more long hair in my cornflakes
No more midnight meowing mews
No more scratchin snarlin spitters
No more sofas clawed to shreds
No more smell of kitty litter
No more mousies in my bed
No I will not take that kitten
Ive had lice and Ive had fleas
Ive been scratched and sprayed and bitten
Ive developed allergies
If youve got an ape Ill take him
If you have a lion thats fine
If you brought some walking bacon
Leave him here Ill treat him kind
I have room for mice and gerbils
I have beds for boars and bats
But please please take away that kitten
Quickfore it becomes a cat
Wellit is kind of cute at that
On the way to the bottom
I met an ole friend of mine
He said Buddy I do believe
this is the end of the line
I said The end of the line
Shoot come on and have another round
And if were headin for the bottom
We still got a long way down
On the way to the bottom
We make a lot of stops
And wed meet a lot of fools
Just a bustin their hearts
On the way to the top
Pass me another bottle
And turn down the lights
Forget about tomorrow baby
Were gonna rumble tonight
Ill wear my low heeled boots
You wear your taffeta gown
and if were heading for the bottom
well go laughing all the way down
On the way to the bottom
I met an ol girl of mine
She said Honey Im scared
Wont you love me one more time
I said One more time
Shoot about a million more
We had a whole lotta loving
And a whole lot more in store
If you were only one inch tall youd ride a worm to school
The teardrop of a crying ant would be your swimming pool
A crumb of cake would be a feast
And last you seven days at least
A flea would be a frightening beast
If you were one inch tall
If you were only one inch tall youd walk beneath the door
And it would take about a month to get down to the store
A bit of fluff would be your bed
Youd swing upon a spiders thread
And wear a thimble on your head
If you were one inch tall
Youd surf across the kitchen sink upon a stick of gum
You couldnt hug your mama youd just have to hug her thumb
Youd run from peoples feet in fright
To move a pen would take all night
This poem took fourteen years to write
Cause Im just one inch tall
Everybody says Im paranoid they all think Im crazy
They all smile to my face but theyd like to see me die
They put poison in my coffee they put ground glass in my oatmeal
They put spiders in my tennis shoes and shit in my pecan pie
Its hard to stop and figure out where did it all begin
You see my father wanted a little girl and my mother wanted twins
And my grandpa admired Hitler so everything I did was wrong
And Im gonna stop now cause even though youre smilin I know you hate this song
Yeah and I know youre only listenin cause you dont wanna hurt my feelins
And youre just waitin for me to leave so you can laugh about my open fly
You put the poison in my coffee you put the ground glass in my oatmeal
You put the spiders in my tennis shoes and you shit in my pecan pie
I know dont deny it I know I know I know
Oh if you read in the papers that shes been seen
A gettin in an out of some millionares long custom made limousine
She may fool you with her smile but I can see
Thats just her poor hopeless heartless helpless pathetic way of gettin over me
So you were down at Joes on the night she broke her zipper
And some wane brain drunk champagne out of her slipper
And she danced on the piano and she screamed hurray Im free
Thats just her poor hopeless heartless helpless pathetic way of gettin over me
Oh shell do anything she can just to make me jealous
Of course forgettin me is gonna take her lots of years
So I call her now and then just out of pitty when she laughs at me
Thats just her way of bravely holding back her tears
Whats that you say she got married oh the poor little fool
To some handsome movie star with the mansion and a swimming pool
And shes looking good and shes got a kid or two or three
Thats just her poor hopeless heartless helpless pathetic way of gettin over me
Pathetic way of tryin to get over me but she aint never gonna make it honey
I mean those guys those guys you see her with now
Theyre theyre the relatives maybe business assiciates
I mean I know this woman and shes sittin home bitin her fingernails
Let me tell you shes just readin magazines
She she may look like shes enjouin herself
Thats the way she looks when shes really gettin bad I know this woman
He rode through the woods on a big blue ox
He had fists as hard as choppin blocks
Five hundred pounds and nine feet tallthats Paul
Talk about workin when he swung his axe
You could hear it ring for a mile and a half
Then hed yellTimber and down shed fallfor Paul
Talk about drinkin that mans so mean
That hed never drink nothin but kerosene
And a fivegallon can is a little bit smallfor Paul
Talk about tough well he once had a fight
With a thunderstorm on a cold dark night
I aint sayin who won
But it dont storm at allround herethanks to Paul
He was ninety years old when he said with a sigh
I think Im gonna lay right down and die
Cause sunshine and sorrow Ive seen it allsays Paul
He says There aint no man alive can kill me
Aint no woman round can thrill me
And I think heaven just mught be a ballsays Paul
So he diedcan we cried
It took eighteen men just to bust the ground
It took twentyfour more just to lower him down
And we covered him up and we figured that was allfor Paul
But late one night the trees started shakin
The dogs started howlin and the earth started quakin
And out of the ground with a Hi yallcomes Paul
He shook the dirt from off his clothes
He scratched his butt and wiped his nose
Ykknow bein dead wasnt no fun at allsays Paul
He says Up in heaven they got harps on their knees
They got clouds and wings but they got no trees
I dont think thats much of a heaven at allsays Paul
So he jumps on his ox with a faretheewell
He says Ill find out if theres trees in hell
And he rode away and that was allwe ever seenof Paul
But the next time you hear a Timber yell
That sounds like its comin from the pits of hell
Then a weird and devilish ghostly wail
Like somebodys choppin on the devils tail
Then a shout a call a crash a fall
That aint no mortal man at allthats Paul
Said General Clay to General Gore really must we fight this silly war
To kill and die in such a bore I quite agree said General Gore
Said General Gore to General Clay we could go to the beach today
And have some icecream on the way a grand idea said General Clay
Said General Clay to General Gore well build sand castles on the shore
Said General Gore well splash and play lets leave right now said General Clay
Said General Gore to General Clay but what if the seas closed today
And what if the sands been blown away the dreadful thought said General Clay
Said General Gore to General Clay Ive always feared the oceans spray
And we may drown its true we may it chills my blood said General Clay
Said General Clay to General Gore my bathin suit is slightly tore
We better go on with our war I quite agree said General Gore
The General Clay chanrged General Gore as bullets flew and cannons roared
And now at last there is no more of General Clay or General Gore
Ill sing you a poem of a silly young king
Who played with the world at the end of a string
But he only loved one single thing
And that was just a peanutbutter sandwich
His scepter and his royal gowns
His regal throne and golden crowns
Were brown and sticky from the mounds
And drippings from each peanutbutter sandwich
His subjects all were silly fools
For he had passed a royal rule
That all that they could learn in school
Was how to make a peanutbutter sandwich
He would not eat his sovereign steak
He scorned his soup and kingly cake
And told his courtly cook to bake
An extrasticky peanutbutter sandwich
And then one day he took a bit
And started chewing with delight
But found his mouth was stuck quite tight
From that last bite of peanutbutter sandwich
His brother pulled his sister pried
The wizard pushed his mother cried
My boys committed suicide
From eating his last peanutbutter sandwich
The dentist came and the royal doc
The royal plumber banged and knocked
But still those jaws stayed tightly locked
Oh darn that sticky peanutbutter sandwich
The carpenter he tried with pliers
The telephone man tried with wires
The firemen they tried with fire
But couldnt melt that peanutbutter sandwich
With ropes and pulleys drills and coil
With steam and lubricating oil
For twenty years of tears and toil
They fought that awful peanutbutter sandwich
Then all his royal subjects came
They hooked his jaws with grapplin chains
And pulled both ways with might and main
Against that stubborn peanutbutter sandwich
Each man and woman girl and boy
Put down their ploughs and pots and toys
And pulled until kerack Oh joy
They broke right through that peanutbutter sandwich
A puff of dust a screech a squeak
The kings jaw opened with a creak
And then in voice so faint and weak
The first words that they heard him speak
Were How about a peanutbutter sandwich
One picture puzzle piece
Lyin on the sidewalk
One picture puzzle piece
Soakin in the rain
It might be a button of blue
On the coat of the woman
Who lived in a shoe
It might be a magical bean
Or a fold in the red
Velvet robe of a queen
It might be the one little bite
Of the apple her stepmother
Gave to Snow White
It might be the veil of a bride
Or a bottle with some evil genie inside
It might be a small tuft of hair
On the big bouncy belly
Of Bobo the Bear
It might be a bit of the cloak
Of the Witch of the West
As she melted to smoke
It might be a shadowy trace
Of a tear that runs down an angels face
Nothing has more possibilities
Than one old wet picture puzzle piece
Oh a little bitty termite you know he come knockin knockin on my front door
Well he walked right in sat right down started chewin on the kitchen floor
You know he chewed out the walls and the ceilings and the halls Lord knows he tried
But he kept gettin thinner and he never got no dinner and finally he sat up and cried
He said its plastic yeah he said its plastic
Well you know it aint no wood and it cant do me no good
Because its plastic he said its plastic
You know that everythings gonna be plastic by and by
Yeah an early one day in the month of May I went down to the beach
You know there were beauties and cuties in little bathin suities
And all of them within my reach
Then a 382436 miss just happened to be passin my way
I said please dont think Im nervy but you look so very curvy
Please tell me how you got that way
She said its plastic she said its just plastic
She said its pretty as can be but you know that it aint me
Because its plastic she said its plastic everythings gonna be plastic by and by
Thanksgiving dinners sad and thankless
Christmas dinners dark and blue
When you stop and try to see it
From the turkeys point of view
Sunday dinner isnt sunny
Easter feasts are just bad luck
When you see it from the viewpoint
Of a chicken or a duck
Oh how I once loved tuna salad
Pork and lobsters lamb chops too
Til I stopped and looked at dinner
From the dinners point of view
Haha I kissed Polly goodnight haha as we stood at her front door
Now shes quite a proper lady so I didnt ask for anything more
But haha I was feeling oh so groovie that I went down to the movie
And I sat down and guess just what I saw
I saw Polly in a porny down at the dirty flicks
I saw Polly in a porny I didnt know she knew them tricks
What I seen nearly struck me blind I never knew she was the artically inclined
I saw Polly in a porny with a pony and Ive nearly blowed my mind
Was she gallopin no no no oh was she trottin no no no
Oh was she riding across the country with some tall dark handsome person
Oh was she wearin her cowboy hat haha well not exactly that
But at least I recall she had her spurs on
I love ol Polly in a porny I keep on going back
Yeah in the very last row Im singin low with my coat bouncin in my lap ooh
I spend each dime I can afford I swear shes gonna win an academy award
I saw Polly in a porny with a pony and the pony seemed a little bored
Ooh oh ride Polly ride slide Polly slide
Chorus
Pour me another tequila Sheila
Take off that red satin dress
Cause I crossed the border
And I beat the dealer for all of that gold in Juarez
I feel like ol Pancho Villa Sheila
And Ive got the pesos to spend
So pour me another tequila Sheila
And lay down and love me again
No I cant tell you about it
Dont mind the gun by my bed
But I feel kinda naked without it
And it eases the fears in my head
I never trusted in woman
But Sheila I trust you tonight
So pass me the salt and a lemon
Bend down and blow out the light
Chorus
Sheila Im hearin your heartbeat
But Im hearing footsteps outside
The courtyard is crawlin with them Federales
And Sheila theres no place to hide
but I dont know who could have tipped em
nobody knew it but you
but I never have trusted in woman
Sheila heres what Im going to do
Chorus
Yeah Pour me another tequila
Im gonna put on your red satin Dress
You put on my clothes and you go face the dealer
Sheila I wish you the best
I never trusted in woman
Sheila I trusted you tonight
So pour me another tequila Sheila
And Ill run for the border again
Yeah Pour me another tequila
Sheila as I ride for the border again
Draw a crazy picture
Write a nutty poem
Sing a mumblegrumble song
Whistle through your comb
Do a loonygoony dance
Cross the kitchen floor
Put something silly in the world
That aint been there before
She fumbles and stumbles
And falls down the stairs
Makes love to the leg of the dining room chair
Shes ready for animals women or men
Shes doing Quaaludes again
I opened my eyes
And looked up at the rain
And it dripped into my head
And flowed into my brain
So pardon this wild crazy thing I just said
Im just not the same since theres rain in my head
I step very softly
I walk very slow
I cant do a handstand
Or I might overflow
And all I can hear as I lie in my bed
Is the slishityslosh of the rain in my head
A hippo sandwich is easy to make
All you do is simply take
One slice of bread
One slice of cake
Some mayonnaise
One onion ring
One hippopotamus
One piece of string
A dash of pepper
That ought to do it
And now comes the problem…
Biting into it
Each time I see the UpsideDown Man
Standing in the water
I look at him and start to laugh
Although I shouldnt oughtter
For maybe in another world
Another time
Another town
Maybe HE is right side up
And I am upside down
Rings of grass crowns of flowers theyre gone gone gone gone
Furs that I woven of whispering hours gone gone gone gone
Shes gone away where the rings are real
And the furs have warmth that a woman can feel
Round and round round goes the wheel
And shes gone gone gone gone gone
Rings of grass and crowns of flowers gone gone gone gone
Castles of sand with seashell towers gone gone gone gone
Shes gone away where the dreams are small
But the castles are rock and they never fall
And left me here to live among all that is gone gone gone gone gone
Rings of grass oh why did they die away gone gone gone gone
Whispering hours where did they fly away gone gone gone gone
And where is the wisdom to understand
That years would crumble our castles of sand
And the flowers and grass turn brown in our hands
When its gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone
If we were a rock n roll band
Wed travel all over the land
Wed play and wed sing and wear spangly things
If we were a rock n roll band
If we were a rock n roll band
And we were up there on the stand
The people would here us and love us and cheer us
Hurray for that rock n roll band
If we were a rock n roll band
Then wed have a million fans
Wed giggle and laugh and sign autographs
If we were a rock n roll band
If we were a rock n roll band
The people would all kiss our hands
Wed be millionaires and have extra long hair
If we were a rock n roll band
But we aint no rock n roll band
Were just seven kids in the sand
With homemade guitars and pails and jars
And drums of potato chip cans
Just seven kids in the sand
Talkn and waven our hands
And dreamin and thinkin oh wouldnt it be grand
If we were a rock n roll band
They had a Rotten Convention
And everyone was there
Hamburger Face and Gruesome Grace
And the Skull with the slimy hair
There was Mr Mud and the Creepin Crud
And the Drooler and Belchin Bob
There was ThreeHeaded Ann she was holdin hands
With the Whimperin Simperin Slob
The Unpronounceable Name he came
And so did SawNose Dan
And Poopin Pete and Smelly Feet
And the HalfInvisible Man
There was Sudden Death and SweatSock Breath
Big Barf and the Deadly Bore
And Killin Dillon and other villains
Wed never seen before
And we all sat around and told bad tales
Of the rottenest people we knew
And everybody there kept askin …
Where were you
Runny lent to the wibrary
And there were bundreds of hooks
Bistory hooks beography gooks
And lots of bory stooks
He looked them over one by one
And guess which one he took
A bience scook A boetry pook
Oh no a bomic cook
Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout
Would not take the garbage out
Shed scour the pots and scrape the pans
Candy the yams and spice the hams
And though her daddy would scream and shout
She simply would not take the garbage out
And so it piled up to the ceilings
Coffee grounds potato peelings
Brown Bananas rotten peas
Chunks of sour cottage cheese
It filled the can it covered the floor
It cracked the window and blocked the door
With bacon rinds and chicken bones
Drippy ends of ice cream cones
Prune pits peach pits orange peel
Gloppy glumps of cold oatmeal
Pizza crusts and withered greens
Soggy beans and tangerines
Crusts of black burned buttered toast
Grisly bits of beefy roasts
The garbage rolled down the hall
It raised the roof it broke the wall
Greasy napkins cookie crumbs
Globs of gooey bubble gum
Cellophane from green baloney
Rubbery blubbery macaroni
Peanut butter caked and dry
Curdled milk and crusts of pie
Moldy melons driedup mustard
Eggshells mixed with lemon custard
Cold french fries and rancid meat
Yellow lumps of Cream of Wheat
At last the garbage reached so high
That finally it touched the sky
And all the neighbors moved away
And none of her friends would come to play
And finally Sarah Cynthia Slylvia Stout said
Ok Ill take the garbage out
But then of course it was too late
The garbage reached across the state
From New York to the Golden Gate
And there in the garbage she did hate
Poor Sarah met an awful fate
That I cannot right now relate
Because the hour is much too late
But children remember Sarah Stout
And always take the garbage out
There was a group called called Scum of the Earth
And they say they got their birth
In a basement bar on Greek Street down in Soho
The bass man he smoked grass and the drummer he kicked ass
And the lead guitar ate speed while everybody boogied
The drummers name was Mavis he was a twice convicted rapist
They say he learned to play in a garage band in Balham
Hed cut out your heart for a dime and he kept lousy time
But the rest of the band was too damned scared to tell him
And The Scum of the Earth they just keep boogyin on
Higher and higher until the fire was burned out and gone
And The Scum of the Earth they just keep boogyin on
Now the bass mans names was Spiker he dressed like a black jacket biker
But underneath his leathers he wore black lace silk panties
They say he sang his sweet love number directly to the drummer
While he kept his eye on the guitar players fanny
On lead guitar was Static he was a hey healthfood fanatic
He lived on berries and nuts and had scurvy and rickets
He did his Yoga excercisin and he kept on tryin and tryin
til finally he could bend all the way over and lick it
And The Scum of the Earth they just keep boogyin on
Higher and higher until the fire was burned out and gone
And The Scum of the Earth they just keep boogyin on
Now one night Scum of the Earth they was playin for all they was worth
Guitar screams and wails and cymbal crashes louder faster and higher
Till their electric cords caught fire and the whole damn band was burned to a pile of ashes
And The Scum of the Earth they just keep boogyin on
Higher and higher until the fire was burned out and gone
And The Scum of the Earth they just keep boogyin on
Every time Ive raced my shadow
When the sun was at my back
It always ran ahead of me
Always got the best of me
But every time Ive raced my shadow
When my face was toward the sun
I won
Hey boys you know once I was took in by a girl with a twinkly eye
And the first time that I wasnt lookin she run off with a handsomer guy oh my
But Im an ingenious feller yeah as soon as my brain got uncurled
I tiptoed right down to my cellar and I built a mechanical girl
Oh her arms are iron her legs are steel her hips are on wires attached to a wheel
And her spine is a coil that I now and then oil shes my everlovin machine
She has no trouble making her mind up for I did not give her a mind
And her heart is a clock that I wind up so I know that shell love me in time
Oh she never complains when I stay out all night she never complains Im not rich
And each time I want her to cuddle me tight I simply turn on her switch
Oh her arms are iron
My love is completely electric and she gives me a shock with each hug
And when the romance gets too hectic I simply pull out the plug
Oh she always did what she was supposed ter right up to this evening but then
She had an affair with the toaster and they ran off and left me again
Oh they wont let us show it at the beach no they wont let us show it at the beach
They think were gonna grab it if it gets within our reach
And they wont let us show it at the beach
But you can show it in your parlor to most anyone you choose
You can show it at a party with your second shot of booze
You can show it on the corner wearin overcoat and shoes
But they wont let us show it at the beach
No they wont let us show it at the beach friends
Ah they wont us show it at the beach
Oh theyre sure were gonna grab it if it gets within our reach
So they wont let us show it at the beach
But you can show it in the movies on the cineramic screen
You can show it in the most sophisticated magazine
You can show it while youre bouncing on the high school trampoline
But they wont let us show it at the beach
But if youve got a gun its legal to display it on your hip
You can show your butcher knives to any interested kid
But if its made for lovin then youd better keep it hid
And they wont let us show it at the beach
Sick I cannot go to school today
Said little Peggy Ann McKay
I have the measles and the mumps
A gash a rash and purple bumps
My mouth is wet my throat is dry
Im going blind in my right eye
My tonsils are as big as rocks
Ive counted sixteen chicken pox
And theres one more thats seventeen
And dont you think my face looks green
My leg is cut my eyes are blue
It might be instamatic flu
I cough and sneeze and gasp and choke
Im sure that my left leg is broke
My hip hurts when I move my chin
My belly buttons caving in
My back is wrenched my ankles sprained
My pendix pains each time it rains
My nose is cold my toes are numb
I have a sliver in my thumb
My neck is stiff my spine is weak
I hardly whisper when I speak
My tongue is filling up my mouth
I think my hair is falling out
My elbows bent my spine aint straight
My temperature is oneoeight
My brain is shrunk I cannot hear
There is a hole inside my ear
I have a hangnail and my heart is
what Whats that Whats that you say
You say today is Saturday
Gbye Im going out to play
Josie it´s been a long hard day
Down the road to where it´s at
I must have lost my way
When I got there they said I was too late
Now you´re the only one can get me straight
So won´t you sing me a rainbow Josie
Roll me a song
Just tonight make it right
Cause it´s been wrong for oh so long
There´s lots of shades of darkness Josie
Deep inside a man
So sing me a rainbow if you can
The train I went to meet
Had come and gone
Seems like I spend all my time
Gettin´ off and gettin´ on
I sold my mind
And gave my dreams away
And tomorrow I´ll start lookin´
´Round for yesterday
But til then
Sing me a rainbow Josie
Roll me a song
Just tonight make it right
Cause it´s been wrong for oh so long
There´s lots of kinds of hunger Josie
You don´t understand
So sing me a rainbow if you can
If you can If you can
Sing me a rainbow if you can
This evening I unzipped my skin
And carefully unscrewed my head
Exactly as I always do
When I prepare myself for bed
And while I slept a coocoo came
As naked as could be
And put on the skin
And screwed on the head
That once belonged to me
Now wearing my feet
He runs through the street
In a most disgraceful way
Doin things and sayin things
Id never do or say
Ticklin the children
And kickin the men
And Dancin the ladies away
So if he makes your bright eyes cry
Or makes your poor head spin
That scoundrel you see
Is not really me
Hes the coocoo
Whos wearing my skin
A piece of sky
Broke off and fell
Through the crack in the ceiling
Right into my soup
KERPLOP
I really must state
That I usually hate
Lentil soup but I ate
Every drop
Delicious delicious
A bit like plaster
But so delicious goodness sake
I could have eaten a lentilsoup lake
Its amazing the difference
A bit of sky can make
My dad gave me one dollar bill
Cause Im his smartest son
And I swapped it for two shiny quarters
Cause two is more then one
And then I took the quarters
And traded them to Lou
For three dimes I guess he didnt know
That three is more than two
Just then along came old blind Bates
And just cause he cant see
He gave me four nickels for my three dimes
And four is more than three
And I took the nickels to Hiram Coombs
Down at the seedfeed store
And the fool gave me five pennies for them
And five is more than four
And I went and showed my dad
And he got red in the cheeks
And closed his eyes and shook his head
Too proud of me to speak
I made myself a snowball
As perfect as could be
I thought Id keep it as a pet
And let it sleep with me
I made it some pajamas
And a pillow for its head
Then last night it ran away
But first it wet the bed
Somebody has to go polish the stars
Theyre looking a little bit dull
Somebody has to go polish the stars
For the eagles and starlings and gulls
Have all been complaining theyre tarnished and worn
They say they want new ones we cannot afford
So please get your rags
And your polishing jars
Somebody has to go polish the stars
Im haulin twenty tons of freight into New York state
Started thinkin bout Mary Jane
She lived over the hill I had an hour to kill I thought Id get in out of the rain
Oh my she looked so fine had a bottle of wine
Id have myself a little bitty swig
Then I heard wheels on the cinders and I ran to the windows
And somebody stole my rig
Oh oh oh somebody stole my rig somebody stole my rig
Heard wheels on the cinders and I ran to the windows
And somebody stole my rig
And when I called up the cops told em I tried to stop em
And nobody answered the phone
And so I called up my honey told her send me bus money
She said dont bother comin home
And so I called the boss and said the load was lost
I thought hes gonna flip his wig
Yeah a moment quick enjoyment now Im back on unemployment
Cause somebody stole my rig
Oh somebody stole my rig somebody stole my rig
Hey a moment quick enjoyment now Im back on unemployment
Cause somebody stole my rig
But if I ever get a job behind the wheel again
Im never gonna fool around
Ill keep an eye on the road and an eye on the load
Ill never even slow it down
And Ill stay concerned with the lesson I learned
I bet its gonna change my luck
And Ill never leave a truck to go visit no girl
Im gonna bring the girls to the truck
Oh somebody stole my rig somebody stole my rig
Moment quick enjoyment now Im back on unemployment
Cause somebody stole my rig
Yeah wheels on the cinders and I ran to the windows
And somebody stole my rig
Yeah I tell ya my blackbook was in the glove compartment
Thats what really bugs me uh huh
I I dint mind walkin or losin my job or anythin
Somebody stole my rig
I mean they could have borrowed it and ask me before
Well Ive told you someday Id have a lotta money
And you would see me grinnin from ear to ear
Look in my pocket this aint gabbage that Im foldin baby
Oh oh somedays here
And I told you someday Ill come driving up your driveway
In a Cadillac that stretched across from here to here
Look out your window this aint no Mack truck Im drivin oh somedays here
Yeah you should have stucked with me just a little bit longer baby
When I was ragged and thin
You should have stuck with me till I got a little bit stronger baby
But you wanted the battle now youre up the creek without a paddle
Say I told you someday Id have so many women
That if I try to count em it would take a year
Look in the back seat this aint no football team Im drivin with
Aw somedays here
harmonica
You should have stuck with me
Say I told you someday you come crawlin to me
Beggin pleadin scratchin cryin crocodile tears
Look at my feet is that my dog Rover no its you
Aw somedays here hmm somedays here
Someone ate the baby its rather sad to say
Someone ate the baby so she wont be out to play
Well never hear her whiney cry or have to feel if she is dry
Well never hear her asking why why why someone ate the baby
Someone ate the baby its absolutely clear
Someone ate the baby cause the baby isnt here
Well give away her toys and clothes well never have to wipe her nose
Dad says thats the way it goes someone ate the baby
Someone ate the baby what a frightful thing to eat
Someone ate the baby though she wasnt very sweet
It was a heartless thing to do the policemen havent got a clue
I simply cant imagine who would go and burp eat the baby
I remember I put on my socks
I remember I put on my shoes
I remember I put on my tie
That was painted
In beautiful purples and blues
I remember I put on my coat
To look perfectly grand at the dance
Yet I fell there is something
I may have forgot
What is it What is it
Big Barney Fitch he got soddenly rich
He got a big fancy house in Melbourne
With buckets of loot and big black leather boots
Acting so haughty and wellborn
But we of Australia were children of convicts
And some of us wear it quite proudly
So as he rides by in his carriage so fine
I wave and I call to him loudly
Refrain
Was your grandma a whore was your grandpa a thief
Were they forgers and grafters who fell to their grief
If youre born of Australia I know who ya be
Youre the son of a son of a scoundrel like me
Maggie McKays got a sweetlovin way
And I know that she does adore me
But her parents they feel it would be a bad deal
They say that shes much too good for me
So as we said goodbye with a tear in her eye
They were smiling and glad of the breakin
But they didnt look so proud when I shouted out loud
Til the whole floggin town was awakened
Refrain
Madam Marie loves the men from the sea
She says that theyre good for business
Her daughters are found in a section of town
Known for a certain rudeness
Then the cops paid a call and the judge says Thats all
Its time for a new profession
Marie laughed out loud and in front of the crowd
Says Judge will you answer this question
Refrain
Did you hear bout Stacy brown no we didnt but wed like to
He had every chick in town no he didnt but he tried to
He had looks he had class do anything to get a little lass
And everyone would shout at him when he walks his girlies past
They said everybody got one everybody got one
Everybody got one everybody got one Stacy brown got two oooh
Do you know the reason for his success no we dont so tell us
They say that he was double blessed not like you fellas
They say that Stacy Brown was born just a little bit deformed
Still his girl friends they all wake up smilin every morn
Singin everybody got one
guitar Why theyre climbin up the wall just to get to Stacy
Young ones run and old ones crawl he drives us crazy
He got two and thats a fact but no one knows where the other ones at
On his elbow on his knee or underneath his hat
Singin everybody got one
He got two I tell you truth its a fact no I aint seen her but no I mean its a fact
Well thats what my old lady told me
No I dont I dont why she knows how did she know
Maybe somebody told her huh gossip maybe its gossip how did she know
Maybe just seems like two I wanna talk to that woman
Policeman policeman
Help me please
Someone went and stole my knees
I’d chase him down but I suspect
My feet and legs just won’t connect
I said Ill take the Tbone steak
A soft voice mooed Oh wow
And I looked up and realized
The waitress was a cow
I cried Mistakeforget the the steak
Ill take the chicken then
I heard a clucktwas just my luck
The busboy was a hen
I said Okay no fowl today
Ill have the seafood dish
Then I saw through the kitchen door
The cookhe was a fish
I screamed Is there anyone workin here
Whos an onion or a beet
No Yourre sure Okay then friends
A salads what Ill eat
They looked at me Ohno they said
The owner is a cabbage head
Some dummy built this pencil wrong
The erasers down here where the point belongs
And the points at the top so its no good to me
Its amazing how stupid some people can be
Now I was hangin round Nashville writin songs and playin em for all of the stars
Watchin em laugh and hand em back livin on hope and Hershey bars
So I pawned my guitar and bought a ticket home and Is headin for the Trailway bus
When I seen an old fountain pen laying in the gutter so I stopped and picked it up
It was wornout bent and cast aside you know kinda sorta like myself
So I sat down on the curb and wrote a little song
That told the world how both of us felt
Then I run that song down to Music Row and before I had time to spit
Its pitched and sold and cut for a record
And moving up the charts and damn its a hit
So I wrote me another winner then I wrote me a smash again
And Is a flyin off the ground cause I knew Id found me a sure hit songwriters pen
So the songs they just kept apourin out and the money kept pouring in
I just couldnt miss all it took was a twist of my sure hit songwriters pen
Remember when I won the Grammy then I won it again and again
Well none of you knew that it was all due to my sure hit songwriters pen
I was darling with all the ladies I was a hero among the men
Making big dough working rodeos and TV shows me and my sure hit songwriters pen
But then one night in Wichita I was just coming off of the stage
Folks all lined up and did crawl for my autograph Lord I was a national rage
One little freckled face girl was there she said I got no pencil sir
So I signed it with my songwriters pen and then handed the pen back to her
Four oclock that morning I wake up with the shakes and the bends
With terror in my eyes cause good God I realized Id lost my sure hit songwriters pen
I offered rewards in the papers I pleaded on the Sympathy Line
And a whole lotta folks and a whole lotta pens but none of them pens was mine
So my songs got worse and my money ran out and so did all my socalled friends
And there was no doubt I was nothing without my longlost sure hit songwriters pen
So I rolled like a stone down old Skid Row where I feed my blues on wine
And I rest my chops in a twobit flop and I tell my story for a drink or a dime
And I sleep with my shoes underneath my head and I dream about days back then
When I blazed my name across the sky with my sure hit songwriters pen
Somewhere in Wichita some little girl whos a freckled face nine or ten
Is doing her arithmetic homework tonight with a sure hit songwriters pen
God bless ya honey you got yourself my sure hit songwriters pen

It was nine oclock at midnight at a quarter after three
When a turtle met a bagpipe on the shoreside by the sea
And the turtle said My dearie
May I sit with you Im weary
And the bagpipe didnt say no
Said the turtle to the bagpipe I have walked this lonely shore
I have talked to waves and pebblesbut Ive never loved before
Will you marry me today dear
Is it No youre going to say dear
But the bagpipe didnt say no
Said the turtle to his darling Please excuse me if I stare
But you have the plaidest skin dear
And you have the strangest hair
If I begged you pretty please love
Could I give you just one squeeze love
And the bagpipe didnt say no
Said the turtle to the bagpipe Ah you love me Then confess
Let me whisper in your dainty ear and hold you to my chest
And he cuddled her and teased her
And so lovingly he squeezed her
And the bagpipe said Aaooga
Said the turtle to the bagpipe Did you honk or bray or neigh
For Aaooga when your kissed is such a heartless thing to say
Is it that I have offended
Is it that our love is ended
And the bagpipe didnt say no
Said the turtle to the bagpipe Shall i leave you darling wife
Shall i waddle off to Woedom Shall i crawl out of your life
Shall I move depart and go dear
Oh I beg you tell me No dear
But the bagpipe didnt say no
So the turtle crept off crying and he neer came back no more
And he left the bagpipe lying on that smooth and sandy shore
And some night when tide is low there
Just walk up and say Hello there
And politely ask the bagpipe if this storys really so
I assure you darling children the bagpipe wont say No
The morning sun touched lightly on
The eyes of Lucy Jordan
In her white suburban bedroom
In a white suburban town
As she lay there neath the covers
Dreaming of a thousand lovers
Till the world turned to orange
And the room went spinning round
At the age of 37
She realized shed never ride
Through Paris in a sports car
With the warm wind in her hair
So she let the phone keep ringing
As she sat there softly singing
Little nursery rhymes shed memorized
In her daddys easy chair
Her husband is off to work
And the kids are off to school
And there were oh so many ways
For her to spend the day
She could clean the house for hours
Or rearrange the flowers
Or run naked through the shady streets
Screaming all the way
At the age of 37
She realized shed never ride
Through Paris in a sports car
With the warm wind in her hair
So she let the phone keep ringing
As she sat there softly singing
Little nursery rhymes shed memorized
In her daddys easy chair
The evening sun touched gently on
The eyes of Lucy Jordan
On the roof top where she climbed
When all the laughter grew too loud
And she bowed and curtsied to the man
Who reached and offered her his hand
And he led her down to the long white car
That waited past the crowd
At the age of 37
She knew shed found forever
As she rolled along through Paris
With the warm wind in her hair
I live in fear of the snow said the bear
Whenever its here be sure Ill be there
Oh the pain and the cold
when ones bearish and old
I live in fear of the snow
I live in fear of the fire said the snow
Whenever it comes then its time I must go
with its yellow lick flames
leaping higher and higher
I live in fear of the fire
I live in fear of the river said the fire
It can drown all my flames anytime it desires
and the thought of the wet
makes me sputter and shiver
I live in fear of the river
I live in fear of the bear said the river
It can lap me right up dont you know
While a mile away
you can hear the bear say
I live in fear of the snow
Im being swallered by a Boa Constrictor
a Boa Constrictor a Boa Constrictor
Im being swallered by a Boa Constrictor
and I dont like snakes one bit
Oh no he swallered my toe
Oh gee he swallered my knee
Oh fiddle he swallered my middle
Oh what a pest he swallered my chest
Oh heck he swallered my neck
Oh dread he swallered my BURP
This bridge will only take you halfway there
To those mysterious lands you long to see
Through gypsy camps and swirling Arab fairs
And moonlit woods where unicorns run free
So come and walk awhile with me and share
The twisting trails and wondrous worlds Ive known
But this bridge will only take you halfway there
The last few steps youll have to take alone
Im the Dragon of Grindly Grun
I breathe fire as hot as the sun
When a knight comes to fight
I just toast him on sight
Like a hot crispy cinnamon bun
When I see a fair damsel go by
I just sigh a fiery sigh
And shed baked like a tater
I think of her later
With a romantic tear in my eye
Im the Dragon of Grindly Grun
But my lunches arent very much fun
For I like my damsels medium rare
and they always come out well done
Said General Clay to General Gore
Oh must we fight this silly war
To kill and die is such a bore
I quite agree said General Gore
Said General Gore to General Clay
We could go to the beach today
And have some ice cream on the way
A grand idea said General Clay
Said General Gore to General Clay
But what if the sea is closed today
And what if the sands been blown away
A dreadful thought said General Clay
Said General Gore to General Clay
Ive always feared the oceans spray
And we may drown Its true we may
It chills my blood said General Clay
Said General Clay to General Gore
My bathing suit is slightly tore
Wed better go on with our war
I quite agree said General Gore
Then General Clay charged General Gore
As bullets flew and cannons roared
And now alas there is no more
Of General Clay or General Gore
Once there was a tree
and she loved a little boy
And everyday the boy would come
and he would gather her leaves
and make them into crowns
and play king of the forest
He would climb up her trunk
and swing from her branches
and eat apples
And they would play hideandgoseek
And when he was tired
he would sleep in her shade
And the boy loved the tree
very much
And the tree was happy
But time went by
And the boy grew older
And the tree was often alone
Then one day the boy came to the tree
and the tree said Come Boy come and
climb up my trunk and swing from my
branches and eat apples and play in my
shade and be happy
I am too big to climb and play said
the boy
I want to buy things and have fun
I want some money
Im sorry said the tree but I
have no money
I have only leaves and apples
Take my apples Boy and sell them in
the city Then you will have money and
you will be happy
And so the boy climbed up the
tree and gathered her apples
and carried them away
And the tree was happy
But the boy stayed away for a long time
and the tree was sad
And then one day the boy came back
and the tree shook with joy
and she said Come Boy climb up my trunk
and swing from my branches and be happy
I am too busy to climb trees said the boy
I want a house to keep me warm he said
I want a wife and I want children
and so I need a house
Can you give me a house 
 I have no house said the tree
The forest is my house
but you may cut off
my branches and build a
house Then you will be happy
And so the boy cut off her branches
and carried them away
to build his house
And the tree was happy
But the boy stayed away for a long time
And when he came back
the tree was so happy
she could hardly speak
Come Boy she whispered
come and play
I am too old and sad to play
said the boy
I want a boat that will
take me far away from here
Can you give me a boat
Cut down my trunk
and make a boat said the tree
Then you can sail away
and be happy
And so the boy cut down her trunk
and made a boat and sailed away
And the tree was happy
but not really
And after a long time
the boy came back again
I am sorry Boy
said the tree but I have nothing
left to give you
My apples are gone
My teeth are too weak
for apples said the boy
My branches are gone
said the tree  You
cannot swing on them 
I am too old to swing
on branches said the boy
My trunk is gone  said the tree
You cannot climb 
I am too tired to climb said the boy
I am sorry sighed the tree
I wish that I could give you something
but I have nothing left
I am just an old stump
I am sorry
I dont need very much now said the boy
just a quiet place to sit and rest
I am very tired
Well said the tree straightening
herself up as much as she could
well an old stump is good for sitting and resting
Come Boy sit down Sit down and rest
And the boy did
And the tree was happy
Twas sunset down in old Key West
The locals all were high
The tourists snapped their photographs
And munched their Key Lime pie
And meanwhile down at Sloppy Joes
The drinks were standin tall
With Buffett on the jukebox
And Hemingway on the wall
Then up spoke Sam the Shrimper
He said Ive been a shrimper all my life
My daddy was a shrimper
And my moms a shrimpers wife
And Im tired of bein a shrimper
Cuz a shrimpers lifes too tame
So Im gonna ride the Conch Train boys
And be like Jesse James
Gonna be like Jesse James boy
Gonna be like Jesse James
Case you didnt hear me the first three times
Gonna be like Jesse James
Now the Conch Train is a tourist toy
That rolls through Key West Town
Like some weird ride from Disneyland
It drives the tourists round and round
While the engineer on her PA
Points out all the sites
Well Tennessee did youknowwhat
To youknowwho that night
The tourists all have money said Sam
Their wives all have rings of gold
Their mopeds all are pawnable
Their cameras can be sold
And think of all the glory boys
The money and the fame
To be the first and only man
To rob the Key West Train
Now the engineer of the Conch Train
Her name was Betsy Wright
She drove the Conch Train all day long
And loved Shrimper Sam all night
And with some sweet persuasion
She agreed to join the game
Shed slow it down and flag the lad
And let him ride the train
The conch train made its turn
Down the Smathers Pitch
When Shrimper Sam with a snorkle eye
Leaped naked from the sea
His fillet knife was in his hand
He jumped aboard the train
Give up your bucks you tourist schmucks
Im Key West Jesse James
Im Key West Jesse James boy
Key West Jesse James
Case you didnt hear me the first three times
Im Key West Jesse James
Now unbeknownst to Shrimper Sam
In the third car from the rear
Sat Kelso Bolls from Muscle Shoals
An American Legioneer
He was a redneck of respect
And a marksman of reknown
From under his fat
He drew a Gat
And shot the shrimper down
Now the first time that he shot poor Sam
Sam groaned and clutched his side
The second time that he shot poor Sam
Sam fell to his knees and cried
And the third time that he shot poor Sam
You could see in both their eyes
Lash LaRue and Randolph Scott
Beneath the Western skies
We laid poor Sam upon the sand
And we lifted up his head
We listened close to hear the words
The dying shrimper said
He said Boys you know I had my chance
But I went and botched the job
But how can a boy named Jesse James
Without a train to rob
Then Kelso Bolls took off his hat
And the tears streamed down his face
He said Son I know just how you feel
This worlds a changin place
When history is written
Uh they wont recall our names
But I only got to play Pat Garrett
Cuz you played Jesse James
We buried Sam in the southernmost sands
Close by the southernmost waves
Where sweet Betsy Wright
Cries tears every night
Onto his southernmost grave
And on his tombstone say the words
Stick to your own game
And if you are a shrimper
Do not try to rob a train
The Homework Machine
Oh the Homework Machine
Most perfect
contraption thats ever been seen
Just put in your homework then drop in a dime
Snap on the switch and in ten seconds time
Your homework comes out quick and clean as can be
Here it is nine plus four and the answer is three
Three
Oh me
I guess its not as perfect
As I thought it would be
I have fought against the poodle with his gory deadly paws
I have faced the fearsome kitten wild and bony
And somehow Ive evaded the enormous chomping jaws
Of the frighteningly ferocious Shetland pony
My triumph oer the rabbit is now sung throughout the land
And men still speak in whispers of the day
When attacked by twelve mosquitoes with my one unwounded hand
I killed nine of them and dove the rest away
I have faced the housefly in his lair I have stalked the ladybug
And the caterpillar grim and fierce and hairy
That trophy there is bumblebee and this my favourite rug
Has been fashioned from the hide of a canary
I have dove into the ocean to do combat with a shrimp
I have dared the hen to come on out and fight
I have battled with the butterfly thats why I have this limp
And I slew a monstrous grubworm just last night
But this evening I must sally forth to meet the savage moth
And if I dont come back in time for tea
You shall know that I fell gallantly as gallantly I fought
So please be gentle when you speak of me
Have you been to the land of happy
Where everyones happy all day
Where they joke and they sing
Of the happiest things
And everythings jolly and gay
Theres no one unhappy in Happy
Theres laughter and smiles galore
I have been to The Land of Happy
What a bore
Said the little boy Sometimes I drop my spoon
Said the old man I do that too
The little boy whispered I wet my pants
I do that too laughed the little old man
Said the little boy I often cry
The old man nodded So do I
But worst of all said the boy it seems
Grownups dont pay attention to me
And he felt the warmth of a wrinkled old hand
I know what you mean said the little old man
Mama said Id lose my head
if it wasnt fastened on
Today I guess it wasnt
cause while playing with my cousin
it fell off and rolled away
and now its gone
And I cant look for it
cause my eyes are in it
and I cant call to it
cause my mouth is on it
couldnt hear me anyway
cause my ears are on it
cant even think about it
cause my brain is in it
So I guess Ill sit down
on this rock
and rest for just a minute
Knock knock
Whos there
Me

Thats right
Whats right
Meehoo
Thats what I want to know
Whats what you want to know

Knock knock…
1 little monkey
was goin 2 the store
when he saw a banana 3
hed never climbed be4
By 5 oclock that evenin
he was 6 with a stomach ache
cause 7 green bananas
was what that monkey 8
By 9 oclock that evenin
that monkey was quite ill
so 10 we called the doctor
who was 11 on the hill
The doctor said Youre almost dead
Dont eat green bananas no more
The sick little monkey groaned and said
But thats what I 12 the 34
No I did not take a nap
The nap took me
off the bed and out the window
far beyond the sea
to a land where sleepy heads
read only comic books
and lock their naps in iron safes
so that they cant get took
And soon as I came to that land
I also came to grief
The people pointed at me shouting
Wheres the nap you thief
They took me to the courthouse
The judge put on his cap
He said My child you are on trial
for taking someones nap
Yes all you selfish children
you think just of yourselves
and dont care if the nap you take
belongs to someone else
It happens that the nap you took
without a thought or care
belongs to Bonnie Bowlingbrook
whos sittin cryin there
She hasnt slept in quite some time
just see her eyelids flap
Shes tired drowsy cranky too
cause guess who took her nap
The jury cried Youre guilty yes
youre guilty as can be
But just return the nap you took
And we might set you free
I did not take that nap I cried
I give my solemn vow
and if I took it by mistake
I do not have it now
Oh fiddlefudge cried out the judge
your record looks quite sour
Last night I see you stole a kiss
Last week you took a shower
You beat your eggs youve whipped your cream
at work you punched the clock
Youve even killed an hour or two
weve heard you darn your socks
We know you shot a basketball
youve stolen second base
and we can see youre guilty
from the sleep thats on your face
Go lie down on your blanket now
and cry your guilty tears
I sentence you to one long nap
for ninety million years
And when the other children see
this nap that never ends
no child will ever dare to take
somebodys nap again
An oak tree and a rosebush grew
Young and green together
Talking the talk of growing things
Wind and water and weather
And while the rosebush sweetly bloomed
The oak tree grew so high
That now it spoke of newer things
Eagles mountain peaks and sky
I guess you think youre pretty great
The rose was heard to cry
Screaming as loud as it possibly could
To the treetop in the sky
And now you have no time for flower talk
Now that youve grown so tall
Its not so much that Ive grown said the tree
Its just that youve stayed so small
Dave McGunn was a surfin’ bum half–crazed by the blazin’ sun
From Waikiki to the Bering Sea he rode ’em one by one
Now he hung offshore ’bout a mile or more out where the dolphins played
And his wild eyes gleamed as he schemed and dreamed
To ride the perfect wave
Oh ride the perfect wave Dave ride the perfect wave
If you wait it out and you don’t sell out you may ride
The perfect wave
He crouched in the spray and he waited all day till the sun gave way to the moon
And his legs grew cold and he grew old and wrinkled like a prune
And the years rolled by and the surf broke high and the 40–foot breakers sprayed
But he sneered at ’em all sayin’ Too damn small I’m waitin’
For the perfect wave
He was sleepin’ on his board when he woke to a roar as thunder shook the sea
’Twas the dreaded California quake of 1973
And he stared at the reef in disbelief then paddled with tremblin’ hands
As a monstrous crashin’ tidal wave came roarin’ ’cross the land
It was 12 miles high and it filled the sky the color of boilin’ blood
And cities fell beneath its swell and mountains turned to mud
Its deadly surf engulfed the earth and left not a thing alive
And high on the tip with a smile on his lip was Davey hangin’ five
He hit the top of the Golden Gate at a thousand miles an hour
Over the top of the Empire State and the tip of the Eiffel Tower
And as he wiped out you could hear him shout as he plunged to a watery grave
Hey hi dee hi I’m glad to die –– I’ve rode
The perfect wave
Mrs McTwitter was the babysitter
I think shes a little bit crazy
She thinks a babysitters supposed
To sit upon the baby
Tell me who can
Catch a toucan
Lou can
Just how few can
Ride the toucan
Two can
What kind of goo can
Stick you to the toucan
Glue can
Who can write some
More about the toucan
You can
A long time ago when the earth was green
and there was more kinds of animals than youve ever seen
and they run around free while the world was bein born
and the lovliest of all was the Unicorn
There was green alligators and longneck geese
There was humpy bumpy camels and chimpanzees
There was catsandratsandelephants but sure as youre born
the lovliest of all was the Unicorn
But the Lord seen some sinnin and it caused him pain
He says Stand back Im gonna make it rain
He says Hey Brother Noah Ill tell ya whatcha do
Go and build me a floatin zoo
And you take two alligators and a couple of geese
two humpy bumpy camels and two chimpanzees
Take two catsandratsandelephants but sure as youre born
Noah dont you forget my Unicorn
Now Noah was there he answered the callin
and he finished up the ark just as the rain was fallin
He marched in the animals two by two
and he called out as they went through
Hey Lord I got your two alligators and your couple of geese
your humpy bumpy camels and your chimpanzees
Got your catsandratsandelephants but Lord Im so forlorn
cause I just dont see no Unicorn
Ol Noah looked out through the drivin rain
but the Unicorns were hidin playin silly games
They were kickin and splashin in the misty morn
oh them silly Unicorn
The the goat started goatin and the snake started snakin
the elephant started elephantin and the boat started shaking
The mouse started squeakin and the lion started roarin
and everyones abourd but the Unicorn
I mean the green alligators and the longneck geese
the humpy bumpy camels and the chimpanzees
Noah cried Close the door cause the rain is pourin
and we just cant wait for them Unicorn
Then the ark started movin and it drifted with the tide
and the Unicorns looked up from the rock and cried
And the water come up and sort of floated them away
thats why youve never seen a Unicorn to this day
Youll see a lot of alligators and a whole mess of geese
Youll see humpy bumpy camels and lots of chimpanzees
Youll see catsandratsandelephants but sure as youre born
youre never gonna see no Unicorn
There is a voice inside of you
that whispers all day long
I feel that this is right for me
I know that this is wrong
No teacher preacher parent friend
or wise man can decide
whats right for you just listen to
the voice that speaks inside
The hulk of a man with a beer in his hand looked like a drunk old fool
And I knew that if I hit him right I could knock him off that stool
But everybody said Watch out thats Tiger Man McCool
Hes had a whole lot of fights and he always come out the winner
Yeah hes a winner
But Id had myself about five too many and I walked up tall and proud
I faced his back and I faced the fact that hed never stooped or bowed
I said Tiger Man youre a pussycat and a hush fell on the crowd
I said Lets you and me go outside and see whos the winner
Well he gripped the bar with one big hairy hand and he braced against the wall
He slowly looked up from his beermy God that man was tall
He said Boy I see youre a scrapper so just before you fall
Im gonna tell you just a little what a means to be a winner
He said You see these bright white smilin teeth you know they aint my own
Mine rolled away like Chiclets down a street in San Antone
But I left that person cursin nursin seven broken bones
And he only broke three of mine and that make me a winner
He said Behind his grin I got a steel pin that holds my jaw in place
A trophy of my most successful motorcycle race
And every mornin when I wake and touch this scar across my face
It reminds me of all I got by bein a winner
Now my broken back was the dyin act of handsome Harry Clay
That sticky Cincinnatti night I stole his wife away
But that woman she gets uglier and meaner every day
But I got her boy and thats what makes me a winner
You gotta speak loud when you challenge me son cause its hard for me to hear
With this twisted neck and these migraine pains and this cauliflower ear
N if it werent for this glass eye of mine Id shed a happy tear
To think of all youll get by bein a winner
I got arthuritic elbows boy I got dislocated knees
From pickin fights with thunderstorms and chargin into trees
And my nose been broke so often I might lose it if I sneeze
And son you say you still wanna be a winner
My spine is short three vertebrae and my hip is screwed together
My ankles warn me every time therell be a change in weather
Guess I kicked too many asses and when the kicks all get together
They sure can slow you down when youre a winner
My knuckles are so swollen I can hardly make a fist
Who would have thought old Charlie had a blade taped to his wrist
And my blind eyes where he cut me and my good eyes where he missed
Yeah you lose a couple of things when youre a winner
My head is just a bunch of clumps and lumps and bumps and scars
From chargin broken bottles and buttin crowded bars
And this hernia well it only proves a man cant lift a car
But youre expected to do it all when youre a winner
Got a steel plate inside my skull underneath this storebought hair
My pelvis is aluminum from takin ladies dares
And if you had a magnet son you could lift me off my chair
Im a man of steel but Im rustin what a winner
I got a perforated ulcer I got strictures and incisions
My prostates barely holdin up from those allnight collisions
And Ill have to fight two of you because of my double vision
Youre lookin sick son that aint right for a winner
Winnin that last stockcar race cost me my favorite toes
Winnin that factory foremans job it browned and broke my nose
And these hemorrhoids come from winnin all them goddamn rodeos
Sometimes its a pain in the butt to be a winner
In the war I got the Purple Heart thats why my nerves are gone
And I ruined my liver in drinkin contests which I always won
And I should be retired now rockin on my lawn
But you losers keep comin on makin me a winner
When I walk you can hear my pelvis rattle creak and crack
From my great Olympic HumpOff with that nymphomaniac
After which I spent the next six weeks in traction on my back
While whe walked off smilin leavin me the winner
Now as I kick in your family jewels youll notice my left leg drags
And this jackets kinda padded up where my right shoulder sags
And theres a special part of me I keep in this paper bag
And Ill show it to you if you want to see all of the winner
So I never play the violin and I seldom dance or ski
They say there never was a hero brave and strong as me
But when youre this years hero son youre next years usedtobe
And thats the facts of life when youre a winner
Now you remind me a lot of my younger days with your knuckles clenchin white
But boy Im gonna sit right here and sip this beer all night
And if theres somethin you gotta prove by winnin some silly fight
Well OK I quit I lose son youre the winner
So I stumbled from that barroom not so tall and not so proud
And behind me I could hear the hoots of laughter from the crowd
But my eyes still see and my nose still works and my teeth are still in my mouth
And yknowI guess that makes mea winner
In the laid back California town of sunny San Raphael
Lived a girl named Pearly Sweetcake
You probably knew her well
She was stoned 15 of her 18 years
And her story was widely told
That she could smoke em faster
Than any dude could roll
Well her legend finally reached New York
That grove street walk up flat
Where dwelt the Calistoge Kid
a beatnik from the past
Hed been rolling dope since time began
And he took a cultured toke and said
Jim I can rollem faster than any chick can smoke
So a note gets sent to San Raphael
For the Championship of the World
The Kid demands a smoke off
Well bring him on sayz Pearl
Ill grind his fingers off his hands
hell roll until he drops
Sayz Calistoge Ill smoke that chick til she blows up and pops
So they rent out Yankee Stadium
And the word is quickly spread
Come one come all who walk or crawl
Tickets just two lids a hit
And from every town in Hamlet
Over land and sea they speed
The Worlds greatest dopers
With the Worlds greatest weed
Hashishes from Morocco
Hemp smokers from Peru
And the Shashnicks from Bagoon who smoke the deadly Pugaroo
And those who call it Light of Life
And those that call it Boo
See the dealers and their ladies
Wearing turquoiselace and leather
See the narcos and the closet smokers
Puffing all together
From the teenies who smoke legal
To the ones whove done some time
To the old man who smoked reefer back before it was a crime
And the Grand Old House That Ruth Built
Is filled with the smokes and cries
Of 50000 screamin heads all stoned out of their minds
And they play the National Anthem
And the crowd lets out a roar
As the spotlight hits the Kid and Pearl
Ready for their smokin warrrr
At a table piled up high with grass high as a mountain peak
Just tops and buds of the rarest flowers
Not one stem branch or seed
I mean a Maui a Wowie a Panama Red Alcopoco Gold
It was Sat night at the slammer the gavel was falling like a hammer
As they dragged in every freak from off the road
One by one they entered the cell and the stories that they had to tell
Were all different but all seemed to end on the very same note
They held me down and put it on my nose they even sprinkled a little bit on my clothes
Yeah I know what youre thinkin but I aint one of those
No they held me down and put it in my nose
This wino in the corner got up and shook himself out
He said wWell they held me down and poured it down my throat
Thats what they did
They even planted the bottle in my coat anybody want some
Yeah… the reason why my pants so wet yes they pushed me off the boat
After they held me down and poured it down my throat
And this chick in the next cell she said I heard you guys talking
And let me tell you something he held me down and he put it you know where
Ohhhh… I told him I was a virgin but he didnt care noooo the pig
Ahhhh you see his wallets in my purse whats it doing there
He held me down and put it you know where
And then this cat got up well he half got up
He lifted his head and ae said hey man hey held me down and they put it in my vein
They even held a pistol to my brain or I wouldnta done it
Ohhh these scars on my arms are where I crashed through the window pane
Tryin to get awaaaaaaaaay when they held me down and put it in my vein
And then this cat a rollieeyed cat in a raincoat and shoes
And the bottom of his pants were cut off at the knees he said
She held me down and put it in my face
Oh the disgrace
And thats the fact on which Im gonna base my case
She was overweight and underage and we was at my place
But she held me down and put it in my face
They held me down and made me write this song
Theyve put a brassiere on a camel
She wasnt dressed proper you know
Theyve put a brassiere on a camel
So that her humps wouldnt show
And theyre making other respectable plans
Theyre even even insisting the pigs should wear pants
Theyll dress up the ducks if we give them the chance
Since theyve put a brassiere on a camel
Theyve put a brassiere on a camel
They claim shes more decent that way
Theyve put a brassiere on a camel
The camel had nothing to say
They squeezed her into it ill never know how
They say that she looks more respectable now
Lord knows what theyve got in mind for the cow
Since theyve put a brassiere on a camel
Well now friends youll never guess it so I really must confess it
I just met the sweetest woman of my long dismal life
But a friend of mine said Buddy just in case your mind is muddy
Dont you know that girl youre fooling with is PegLeg Johnsons wife
And that man is big and rough and mean and grim
And hell brain you with his artificial limb
But next morning bright and early I stole old PegLegs girlie
And I also took his wooden leg just to play it safe
But there werent no time for laughter cause he started hopping after
And I keep on running faster but he wont give up the chase
And Im running through the mountain with his bride
And I got his wooden leg here by my side
Im a threelegged man with a twolegged woman
Being chased cross country by a onelegged fool
Though hes huffing and hes puffing and he shows no sign of stopping
I tell you boys this life is hard and cruel
Cross the deserts and the valleys and the dark Chicago alleys
Cross the mighty Mississippi to the hills of Caroline
Through the mountains of Montana and the swamps of Louisiana
Everytime that I look back hes JUST one foot behind
And I know he must be cold and wet and sick
But in spite of all his woes he can kick
Now hes ragged and hes filthy and Im feeling mighty guilty
Specially in the evenings when I hear him plead and beg
He says In spite of all your stealing friend I bear you no hard feelings
You can keep that darned old woman but please give me back my leg
Cause although the one you meant to take was wooden
In the dark by mistake you took my goodun
Oh the thumbsuckers thumb
May look wrinkled and wet
And withered and white as the snow
But the taste of a thumb Is the sweetest taste yet
As only we thumbsuckers know
I met her on a corner in Duluth
That’s the truth
She was tryin’ to fix her shoe in a telephone booth
Her name was Ruth
She said she was just waiting for a bus
But I hid my thumb cause I knew just what she was
And I ain’t gonna let no thumbsucker such my thumb
It’ll drive you crazy and leave you deaf and dumb
It’ll make you crawl and climb the wall
Leave you without no thumb at all
So I ain’t gonna let no thumbsucker suck my thumb
I’ll tell you what them thumbsuckers like to do
They suck your thumb till it’s wrinkled like a prune
They’ll say you’ve got the sweetest thumb of all
But then they suck the thumb of the guy livin’ down the hall
That’s why I ain’t gonna let no thumbsucker suck my thumb
etc etc until finally giving in
Did you hear bout Ticklish Tom
He got tickled by his mom
Wiggled and giggled and fell on the floor
Laughed and rolled right out the door
All the way to school and then
He got tickled by his friends
Laughed till he fell off his stool
Laughed and rolled right out of school
Down the stairs and finally stopped
Till he got tickled by a cop
And all the more that he kept gigglin
All the more folks kept ticklin
He shrieked and screamed and rolled around
Laughed his way right out of town
Through the country down the road
He got tickled by a toad
Past the mountains across the plain
Tickled by the falling rain
Tickled by the soft brown grass
Tickled by the clouds that passed
Giggling rolling on his back
He rolled on the railroad track
Rumble rumble whistle roar
Tom aint ticklish any more
Aint the snow fallin just a bit deeper these days
Arent they building the stairs a bit steeper these days
And the towns really changin in so many ways time time time
The young folks theyre growin exceptionally tall
And the newspaper print its becomin quite small
And folks speak so softly you can hardly hear at all time time time
The jokes dont seem as witty as the old jokes once were
And the girls are half as pretty as I remember her
And today you know in the park a young man called me sir time time time
Yeah Im not quite as anxious for fame or success
And my eye finds the girl in the plain quiet dress
And I cling a bit longer to each warm caress time time time
So I breathe a bit heavy when I climb a hill
What of it my life now is really much more fulfilled
But theyre tearin down the building that I watched them build
Time time time time time time
I tried on the farmers hat
Didnt fit…
A little too small just a bit
Too floppy
Couldnt get used to it
Took it off
I tried on the dancers shoes
A little too loose
Not the kind you could use
for walkin
Didnt feel right in em
Kicked em off
I tried on the summer sun
Felt good
Nice and warm knew it would
Tried the grass beneath bare feet
Felt neat
Finally finally felt well dressed
Natures clothes fit me best
Only ate one drumstick
At the picnic dance this summer
Just one little drumstick
They say I couldnt be dumber
One tough and skinny drumstick
Why was that such a bummer
But everybodys mad at me
Especially the drummer

Handsome guys get girls that are pretty
Other guys make it cause theyre clever and witty
But the only love I ever got I got out of pity cause Im the ugliest man in town
Yeah I drive down the street in a Roys Rolls car
Use hundred dollar bills when I light my cigar
But you know folks that really dont get you very far
When youre the ugliest man in town
There was a note on the doorstep where I was found
Is said this poor child weighs eleven pounds
So bring him up healthy and welthy and sound
Keep his back to the light dont let him turn around
Yeah all you women youre heartless and cold all you want is my silver and gold
Dont you know Ive got a beautiful soul though Im the ugliest man in town
Yeah Im so ugly I gotta shave in the dark
The kids start to cry when I walk through the park
The clock stop tickin and dogs start to bark whenever I come around
Oh oh oh I walk down the street the girls all hiss me
If I died tomorrow not one of them would miss me
Only reason they ball me is they cant stand to kiss me
Im the ugliest man in town oh yeah the ugliest man in town
Fell asleep last night with the TV on
Oh what a dream I had
Dreamed I went and answered evry single
One of those late night mail order ads
Then four to six weeks later
Much to my surprise
The mailman came to my front door
And I couldnt believe my eyes
He brought the Vegematic
And the Pocket Fisherman too
Illuminated illustrated History of Life
And Box Car Willie with a ginsu knife
A bamboo steamer and a garden weasel too
And a tie dyed dayglow souvenir shirt
From Six Flags Over Burbank
Well the doorbell rang all mornin
All through the afternoon
And I shook with fright as it rang all night
By the light of the Mastercard moon
There was Federal Express in the pantry
Parcel Post in the hall
COD to the ceiling
And I just couldnt pay for it all
I got an egg scrambler
With a sealameal carryin case
A set of Presidential Commemorative Plates
So I could eat my eggs off a Presidents face
A minute mender
And a needle thatll knit or crochet
And an autographed photograph of Rin Tin Tin
At Six Flags Over Burbank
Well I know that I was dreamin
So I gave a mighty cheer
When I awoke it was no joke
Cause all that shit was here
So if you fall asleep with the TV on
Let me tell you what to do
Rip the telephone out of the wall
Unless you want this to happen to you
You get Vegematic and the Pocket Fisherman too
Iluminated illustrated History of Life
And Box Car Willie with a ginsu knife
A bamboo steamer and a garden weasel too
And a tie dyed dayglow souvenir shirt

Eat a tomato and youll turn red
I dont think thats really so
Eat a carrot and youll turn orange
Still and all you never know
Eat some spinach and youll turn green
Im not saying that its true
But thats what I heard and so
I thought Id pass it on to you
Inside everybodys nose
There lives a shartoothed snail
So if youi stick your finger in
He may bite off your nail
Stick it farther up inside
And he may bite your ring off
Stick it all the way and he
May bite the whole darn thing off
Someone put their baby brother
Under this basket
The question is exactly why
But Im not going to ask it
But someone I aint sayin who
Has got a guilty face
Ashamed for lettin such a lovely brother
Go to waste
I thought that I had wavy hair
Until I shaved Instead
I find that I have straight hair
And a very wavy head
Birds are flyin south for winter
Heres the WeirdBird headin north
Wings aflappin beak achatterin
Cold head bobbin back n forth
He says Its not that I like ice
Or freezin winds and snowy ground
Its just sometimes its kind of nice
To be the only bird in town
Last night while I lay thinking here
some Whatifs crawled inside my ear
and pranced and partied all night long
and sang their same old Whatif song
Whatif Im dumb in school
Whatif theyve closed the swimming pool
Whatif I get beat up
Whatif theres poison in my cup
Whatif I start to cry
Whatif I get sick and die
Whatif I flunk that test
Whatif green hair grows on my chest
Whatif nobody likes me
Whatif a bolt of lightning strikes me
Whatif I dont grow talle
Whatif my head starts getting smaller
Whatif the fish wont bite
Whatif the wind tears up my kite
Whatif they start a war
Whatif my parents get divorced
Whatif the bus is late
Whatif my teeth dont grow in straight
Whatif I tear my pants
Whatif I never learn to dance
Everything seems well and then
the nighttime Whatifs strike again
No one knows my lady when shes lonely
No one sees the fantasies and fears my lady hides
There are those whove shared her love and laughter
But no one hears my lady when she cries…but me
No one hears my lady when she cries
And when she cries she makes you wanna run
And chase the sun and bring it back
To brighten up a corner of her dark and troubled skies
When she cries
She walks barefoot through the misty mornin
Dreams of golden yesterdays reflectin in her eyes
But soon the evenin shadows crowd around her
Frightening my lady till she cries…for me
Frightening my lady till she cries
You may have seen her lyin in your lamplight
And if youve heard her whispered words it comes as no surprise
So be the one she shares her secret smiles with
But send me back my lady when she cries…for me
My ladys gonna need me when she cries
There is a place where the sidewalk ends
and before the street begins
and there the grass grows soft and white
and there the sun burns crimson bright
and there the moonbird rests from his flight
to cool in the peppermint wind
Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black
and the dark street winds and bends
Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow
we shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow
and watch where the chalkwhite arrows go
to the place where the sidewalk ends
Yes well walk with a walk that is measured and slow
and well go where the chalkwhite arrows go
for the children they mark and the children they know
the place where the sidewalk ends
I asked the Zebra
Are you black with white stripes
Or white with black stripes
And the zebra asked me
Are you good with bad habits
Or are you bad with good habits
Are you noisy with quiet times
Or are you quiet with noisy times
Are you happy with some sad days
Or are you sad with some happy days
Are you neat with some sloppy ways
Or are you sloppy with some neat ways
And on and on and on and on
And on and on he went
I’ll never ask a zebra
About stripes
Again
Depends on if the judge is fair
Depends how high the heels you wear
Depends on if they count the hair
Depends if they allow the chair
Barbaras eyes are blue as azure
But she is in love with Freddy
Karens sweet but Harry has her
Gentle Jane is going steady
Carol hates me So does May
Abigail will not be mine
Nancy lives too far away
Wont you be my Valentine
Well Ive been spendin my life lookin for a shoulder
To rest my head when the nights get colder
But the days are gettin longer and Im gettin older
Been long time workin it out
I been a long time workin it out I been a long time workin it out
I been a long time workin it out I been a long time workin it out
Now I got a little woman to scrub my floor
Right down the road I got me two or three more
And you know none of them knows about the one next door
I been a long time workin it out
I been a long time workin it out
Well it was late one night when I stole a little money
I bought a couple of things and then gave them to my honey
And the judge said boy if you this thats funny
You got a long time workin it out
I got a long time workin it out
guitar
Yeah well I look all around me and what do I see
The whole wide world got trouble like me
Between the taxes the missus and the deep blue sea
Youll be a long time workin it out
Well be a long time workin it out
All the WouldaCouldaShouldas
Layin in the sun
Talkin bout the things
They woulda coulda shoulda done
But those WouldaCouldaShouldas
All ran away and hid
From one little Did
I knew that she belonged to someone else at the time
But lonesomelookin women are a weakness of mine
And so I bought that stuff about the love he never gave her
And I figured I would love her some and do us both a favor
But just when I got up to leave he walked in the door
And I guess I thought hed be surprised
He looked at me as if to say Ive been here before
And he offered me this word to the wise
cho You know shes a cheater son
And you think that youre the one
Thats got a lot of what it takes to change her
Ive no doubt that you can get her
You aint much but that dont matter
Nothin suits her better than a stranger

Well it wasnt too very long ago you know some folks walked with a hideeho
And other folks walked around kind of low
Sayin Yowzah and Sho nuff and Yassuh boss
It was ashes to ashes and dust to dust and they didnt believe in makin a fuss
So they quietly moved to the back of the bus
They just say Yowzah and Sho nuff and Yassuh boss
And when things got rough they did a little prayin
Little arm wavin and a little bit of swayin
Didnt do no good they kept right on a sayin
Sayin Yowzah and Sho nuff and Yassuh boss
So they all went out and did a little standin little less askin and a lot more demandin
Little less liftin and a little less totin a lot more thinkin and a lot more votin
A lot less hopin a lot less waitin
A whole lot more demonstratina lot less pearly gaten
A lot more fightin and a lot more walkin until finally no one at all was talkin
Like Yowzah and Sho nuff and Yassuh boss
The end of this story is plain to see they finally achieved equality
And now like you and me they can stand up strong and free
And say Yes sir and Of course sir and Anything you say JB
