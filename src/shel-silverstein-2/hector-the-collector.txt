Hector the Collector
Collected bits of string
Collected dolls with broken heads
And rusty bells that would not ring Bent-up nails and ice-cream sticks
Twists of wires worn-out tires
Paper bags and broken bricks
Old chipped vases half shoelaces
Gatlin' guns that wouldn't shoot
Leaky boasts that wouldn't float
And stopped-up horns that wouldn't toot Butter knives that had no handles
Copper keys that fit no locks
Rings that were too small for fingers
Dried-up leaves and patched-up socks
Worn-out belts that had no buckles
'Lectric trains that had no tracks
Airplane models broken bottles
Three-legged chairs and cups with cracks
Hector the Collector
Loved these things with all his soul
Loved them more then shining diamonds
Loved them more then glistenin' gold
Hector called to all the people
'Come and share my treasure trunk!'
And all the silly sightless people
Came and looked  and called it junk
