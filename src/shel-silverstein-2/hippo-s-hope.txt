There once was a hippo who wanted to fly 
Fly-hi-dee try-hi-dee my-hi-dee-ho
So he sewed him some wings that could flap through the sky 
Sky-hi-dee fly-hi-dee why-hi-dee-go
He climbed to the top of a mountain of snow 
Snow-hi-dee slow-hi-dee oh-hi-dee-hoo
With the clouds high above and the sea down below 
Where-hi-dee there-hi-dee scare-hi-dee-boo
Happy ending
And he flipped and he flapped and he bellowed so loud 
Now-hi-dee loud-hi-dee proud-hi-dee-poop
And he sailed like an eagle off into the clouds 
High-hi-dee fly-hi-dee bye-hi-dee-boop
Unhappy ending
And he leaped like a frog and he fell like a stone 
Stone-hi-dee lone-hi-dee own-hi-dee-flop
And he crashed and he drowned and broke all his bones 
Bones-hi-dee moans-hi-dee groans-hi-dee-glop
Chicken ending
He looked up at the sky and looked down at the sea 
Sea-hi-dee free-hi-dee whee-hi-dee-way
And he turned and went home and had cookies and tea 
That's hi-dee all hi-dee I have to say
