No  I did not take a nap 
The nap  took  me
off the bed and out the window
far beyond the sea
to a land where sleepy heads
read only comic books
and lock their naps in iron safes
so that they can't get took
And soon as I came to that land
I also came to grief
The people pointed at me shouting
'Where's the nap you thief?'
They took me to the courthouse
The judge put on his cap
He said 'My child you are on trial
for taking someone's nap
'Yes all you selfish children
you think just of yourselves
and don't care if the nap you take
belongs to someone else
It happens that the nap you took
without a thought or care
belongs to Bonnie Bowlingbrook
who's sittin' cryin' there
'She hasn't slept in quite some time 
just see her eyelids flap
She's tired drowsy  cranky too
'cause guess who took her nap?'
The jury cried 'You're guilty yes
you're guilty as can be
But just return the nap you took
And we might set you free.'
'I did not take that nap,' I cried
'I give my solemn vow
and if I took it by mistake
I do not have it now.'
'Oh fiddle-fudge,' cried out the judge
your record looks quite sour
Last night I see you stole a kiss
Last week you took a shower
'You beat your eggs you've whipped your cream
at work you punched the clock
You've even killed an hour or two
we've heard you darn your socks
We know you shot a basketball
you've stolen second base
and we can see you're guilty
from the sleep that's on your face
'Go lie down on your blanket now
and cry your guilty tears
I sentence you to one long nap
for ninety million years
And when the other children see
this nap that never ends
no child will ever dare to take
somebody's nap again.'
