Pamela Purse yelled 'Ladies first,'
Pushing in front of the ice cream line
Pamela Purse yelled 'Ladies first,'
Grabbing the ketchup at dinnertime
Climbing on the morning bus
She'd shove right by all of us
And there'd be a tiff or a fight or a fuss
When Pamela Purse yelled 'Ladies first.'
Pamela Purse screamed 'Ladies first,'
When we went off on our jungle trip
Pamela Purse said her thirst was worse
And guzzled our water every sip
And when we got grabbed by that wild savage band
Who tied us together and made us all stand
In a long line in front of the King of the land
A cannibal known as Fry-'Em-Up Dan
Who sat on his throne in a bib so grand
With a lick of his lips and a fork in his hand
As he tried to decide who'd be first in the pan
From back of the line in that shrill voice of hers
Pamela Purse yelled 'Ladies first.'
