It was Sat night at the slammer the gavel was falling like a hammer
As they dragged in every freak from off the road
One by one they entered the cell and the stories that they had to tell
Were all different but all seemed to end on the very same note
They held me down and put it on my nose they even sprinkled a little bit on my clothes
Yeah I know what you're thinkin' but I ain't one of those
No they held me down and put it in my nose
This wino in the corner got up and shook himself out
He said wWell they held me down and poured it down my throat
That's what they did
They even planted the bottle in my coat anybody want some
Yeah… the reason why my pants so wet yes they pushed me off the boat
After they held me down and poured it down my throat
And this chick in the next cell she said I heard you guys talking
And let me tell you something he held me down and he put it you know where
Ohhhh… I told him I was a virgin but he didn't care noooo the pig
Ahhhh you see his wallet's in my purse what's it doing there
He held me down and put it you know where
And then this cat got up well he half got up
He lifted his head and ae said hey man hey held me down and they put it in my vein
They even held a pistol to my brain or I wouldn'ta done it
Ohhh these scars on my arms are where I crashed through the window pane
Tryin' to get awaaaaaaaaay when they held me down and put it in my vein
And then this cat a rollie-eyed cat in a raincoat and shoes
And the bottom of his pants were cut off at the knees he said
She held me down and put it in my face
Oh the disgrace
And that's the fact on which I'm gonna base my case
She was overweight and underage and we was at my place
But she held me down and put it in my face
They held me down and made me write this song
