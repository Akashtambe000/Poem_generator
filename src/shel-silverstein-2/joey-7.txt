Joey Joey took a stone
And knocked
Down
The
Sun
And Whoosh It swizzled
Down so hard
And bloomp It bounced
In his backyard
And glunk It landed
On his toe
And the world was dark
And the corn wouldn’t grow
And the wind wouldn’t blow
And the bleep wouldn’t crow
And it always was Night
Night
Night
All because
Of a stone
And Joe
