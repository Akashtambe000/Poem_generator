Down in Lou´siana where the black trees grow
Lives a voodoo lady named Marie Laveaux
She got a black cat tooth and a mojo bone
And anyone wouldn´t leave her alone
She go GREEEEEEEEEEEE
Another man done gone
She live in a swamp in a hollow log
With a one-eyed snake and a three-legged dog
She got a bent bony body and stringy hair
And if she ever seen you messin´ round there
She go GREEEEEEEEEEEE
Another man done gone
And then one night when the moon was black
Into the swamp came Handsome Jack
A no-good man like you all know
And he was lookin´ around for Marie Laveaux 
He said 'Marie Laveau you lovely witch
Why don´t you gimme a little charm that´ll make me rich
Gimme million dollars and I´ll tell you what I´ll do
This very night I´m gonna marry you.'
It´ll be UMMMMMMMM
Another man done gone
So Marie did some magic and she shook a little sand
Made a million dollars and she put it in his hand
Then she looked and she said  'Hey hey
I´m gettin´ ready for my wedding day.'
But ol´ Handsome Jack said 'Good-bye Marie
You too damn ugly for a man like me.'
So Marie started shakin´ her fangs started gnashin´
Her body started shakin´ and her eyes started flashin´
She went GREEEEEEEEEEEE
Another man done gone
So if you ever get down where the black tree grow
And meet a voodoo lady named Marie Laveaux
And if she ever asks you to make her your wife
Man you better stay with her for the rest of your life
Or it´ll be GREEEEEEEEEEEE
Another man done gone
