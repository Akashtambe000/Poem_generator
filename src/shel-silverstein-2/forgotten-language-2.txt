Once I spoke the language of the flowers
Once I understood each word the caterpillar said
Once I smiled in secret at the gossip of the starlings
And shared a conversation with the housefly
in my bed
Once I heard and answered all the questions
of the crickets
And joined the crying of each falling dying
flake of snow
Once I spoke the language of the flowers   
How did it go
How did it go
