Yeah hoodoo voodoo lady cast up your voodoo vision
Let me know where did my baby go where did my lovin' baby go
Hoodoo voodoo lady shake your black cat tooth and your mojo bone
And bring my baby home bring my baby back home yeah
I know she didn't go up to New York City
She thinks that New York City is a little too pretty
I know she didn't go to sunny California
For she thinks that California is a little too phoney
I don't think she went up to north Alaska
She'd've told me cept I might forgot to ask her
And I don't think she went to east St Louis
But she might've gone to China for a little Chop Suey
Wherever she is I'm gonna run right there with you just tell me where
Hoodoo voodoo lady make me a doll that I can stick with pins
So that I can win my baby back again
Yeah c'mon do somethin' weird and mystical...
 guitar 
Yeah I don't think I'll find her in the Okefenokee
Cause the Okefenokee is too wet and smoky
And I don't think I'll find her up in Mississippi
She may be crazy but she ain't that flippy
And she might've seen her sister in Amarillo
And she might've gone to Philly just to see another feller
She might be drillin' oil in North Dakota
Might have gone to Iceland for an icecream soda
But I gotta get her back if I'm gonna get well so cast your spell
Voodoo hoodoo lady mix me a potion hot bubbly and black
That I can sprinkle on her crack and maybe bring my baby back
Hoodoo voodoo lady let me know where did that woman of mine go
