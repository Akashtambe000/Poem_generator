They've put a brassiere on a camel
She wasn't dressed proper you know
They've put a brassiere on a camel
So that her humps wouldn't show
And they're making other respectable plans
They're even even insisting the pigs should wear pants
They'll dress up the ducks if we give them the chance
Since they've put a brassiere on a camel
They've put a brassiere on a camel
They claim she's more decent that way
They've put a brassiere on a camel
The camel had nothing to say
They squeezed her into it i'll never know how
They say that she looks more respectable now
Lord knows what they've got in mind for the cow
Since they've put a brassiere on a camel
