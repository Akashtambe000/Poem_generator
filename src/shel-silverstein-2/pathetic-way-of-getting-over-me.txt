Oh if you read in the papers that she's been seen
A gettin' in an out of some millionare's long custom made limousine
She may fool you with her smile but I can see
That's just her poor hopeless heartless helpless pathetic way of gettin' over me
So you were down at Joe's on the night she broke her zipper
And some wane brain drunk champagne out of her slipper
And she danced on the piano and she screamed hurray I'm free
That's just her poor hopeless heartless helpless pathetic way of gettin' over me
Oh she'll do anything she can just to make me jealous
Of course forgettin' me is gonna take her lots of years
So I call her now and then just out of pitty when she laughs at me
That's just her way of bravely holding back her tears
What's that you say she got married oh the poor little fool
To some handsome movie star with the mansion and a swimming pool
And she's looking good and she's got a kid or two or three
That's just her poor hopeless heartless helpless pathetic way of gettin' over me
Pathetic way of tryin' to get over me but she ain't never gonna make it honey
I mean those guys those guys you see her with now
They're they're the relatives maybe business assiciates
I mean I know this woman and she's sittin' home bitin' her fingernails
Let me tell you she's just readin' magazines
She she may look like she's enjouin' herself
That's the way she looks when she's really gettin' bad I know this woman
