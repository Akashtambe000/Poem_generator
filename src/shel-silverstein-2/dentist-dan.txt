Nentis Nan he's my man
I go do im each chanz I gan
He sicks me down an creans my teed
Wid mabel syrub tick an' sweed
An ten he filks my cavakies
Wid choclut cangy  I tink he's
The graygest nentis in the lan
Le's hear free jeers for Nentis Nan
Pip-pip-ooray
Pip-pip-ooray
Pip-pip-o oray
Le's go to Nentis Nan dooday
