CHORUS
We'll drink a drink adrink
To Lily the Pink the Pink the Pink
The savior of
The human ra-a-ace
She invented
Medicinal Compound
Most efficacious
In every case
Now here's a story
A little bit gory
A little bit happy
A little bit sa-a-ad
Of Lily the Pink and
Her Medicinal Compound
And how it drove
Her to the bad
Oh Ebeneezer thought  weird scansion I know
He was Julius Caesar
And so they put him in a ho-ho-home
Till they gave him
Medicinal Compound
And now he's Em
Peror of Rome
CHORUS
Oh Domingo
The opera singer
Could break glasses with his voice they said
He rubbed his tonsils
With Medicinal Compound
And now they break glass
Es over his head
Uncle Paul he
Was very small he
Was the shortest man in tow-ow-own
He rubbed his body
With Medicinal Compound
And now he weighs just
Half a pound
CHORUS
Jimmy Hammer
Had a t-t-t-terrible st-stammer
He c-could hardly s-s-say a w-wo a wo a wo-o-ord
Till he took some
Medicinal C-c-c-compound
And now he's seen
But never heard
Lily died
Went up to Heaven
All the church bells they did ri-i-ing
She took with her
Medicinal Compound
Hark the Herald
Angels sing
CHORUS
For the record Lydia Pinkham's Medicinal Compound
was a concoction sold in drugstores some years ago
which was about 97 alcohol and advertized itself
as being able to cure practically anything I believe
this song was written by Shel Silverstein
