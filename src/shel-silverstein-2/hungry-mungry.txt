Hungry Mungry sat at supper
Took his knife and spoon and fork
Ate a bowl of mushroom soup ate a slice of roasted pork
Ate a dozen stewed tomatoes twenty-seven deviled eggs
Fifteen shrimps nine bakes potatoes
Thirty-two fried chicken legs
A shank of lamb a boiled ham
Two bowls of grits some black-eye peas
Four chocolate shakes eight angel cakes
Nine custard pies with Muenster cheese
Ten pots of tea and after he
Had eaten all that he was able
He poured some broth on the tablecloth
And ate the kitchen table
His parents said 'Oh Hungry Mungry stop these silly jokes.'
Mungry opened up his mouth and 'Gulp,' he ate his folks
And then he went and ate his house all the bricks and wood
And then he ate up all the people in the neighborhood
Up came twenty angry policeman shouting 'Stop and cease.'
Mungry opened his mouth and 'Gulp,' he ate the police
Soldiers came with tanks and guns
Said Mungry 'They can't harm me.'
He just smiled and licked his lips and ate the U.S Army
The President sent all his bombers Mungry still was calm
Put his head back gulped the planes and gobbled up the bomb
He ate his town and ate the city ate and ate and
And then he said 'I think I'll eat the whole United States.'
And so he ate Chicago first and munched the Water Tower
And then he chewed on Pittsburgh but he found it rather sour
He ate New York and Tennessee and all of Boston town
Then drank the Mississippi River just to wash it down
And when he'd eaten every state each puppy boy and girl
He wiped his mouth upon his sleeve and went to eat the world
He ate the Egypt pyramids and every church in Rome
And all the grass in Africa and all in ice in Nome
He ate each hill in green Brazil and then to make things worse
He decided for dessert he'd eat the universe
He started with the moon and stars and soon as he was done
He gulped the clouds he sipped the wind and gobbled up the sun
Then sitting there in the cold dark air
He started to nibble his feet
Then his legs then his hips
Then his neck then his lips
Till he sat there just gnashin' his teeth
'Cause nothin' was nothin' was
Nothin' was nothin' was
Nothin' was left to eat
