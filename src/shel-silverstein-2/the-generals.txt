Said General Clay to General Gore
'Oh must we fight this silly war
To kill and die is such a bore.'
'I quite agree,' said General Gore
Said General Gore to General Clay
'We could go to the beach today
And have some ice cream on the way.'
'A grand idea,' said General Clay
Said General Gore to General Clay
'But what if the sea is closed today
And what if the sand's been blown away?'
'A dreadful thought,' said General Clay
Said General Gore to General Clay
'I've always feared the ocean's spray
And we may drown!' 'It's true we may
It chills my blood,' said General Clay
Said General Clay to General Gore
'My bathing suit is slightly tore
We'd better go on with our war.'
'I quite agree,' said General Gore
Then General Clay charged General Gore
As bullets flew and cannons roared
And now alas there is no more
Of General Clay or General Gore
