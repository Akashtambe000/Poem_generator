I used to be a prancer
a one-eyed song and dancer
But eyes for true romance
I didn't even try
I'd get'em and forget'em
But I never could stay with'em
Cause I thought my well of love had done run dry
But now it's bubblin' up
I feel it bubblin' up
And you can't hold back this true love
no matter what you do
Because it's bubblin' up
you can hear it baby
It's bubblin' up
And it'll soon be bubblin' over just for you
Get that look off your face!
I know the one I met you
You loved me and I let you
But I'd gladly bet you
that it wouldn't last too long
But I had no way of knowing
that this thing would keep on growin'
And now the feeling still is going strong
And yes it's bubblin' up
