I'm haulin' twenty tons of freight into New York state
Started thinkin' bout Mary Jane
She lived over the hill I had an hour to kill I thought I'd get in out of the rain
Oh my she looked so fine had a bottle of wine
I'd have myself a little bitty swig
Then I heard wheels on the cinders and I ran to the windows
And somebody stole my rig
Oh oh oh somebody stole my rig somebody stole my rig
Heard wheels on the cinders and I ran to the windows
And somebody stole my rig
And when I called up the cops told 'em I tried to stop 'em
And nobody answered the phone
And so I called up my honey told her send me bus money
She said don't bother comin' home
And so I called the boss and said the load was lost
I thought he's gonna flip his wig
Yeah a moment quick enjoyment now I'm back on unemployment
Cause somebody stole my rig
Oh somebody stole my rig somebody stole my rig
Hey a moment quick enjoyment now I'm back on unemployment
Cause somebody stole my rig
But if I ever get a job behind the wheel again
I'm never gonna fool around
I'll keep an eye on the road and an eye on the load
I'll never even slow it down
And I'll stay concerned with the lesson I learned
I bet it's gonna change my luck
And I'll never leave a truck to go visit no girl
I'm gonna bring the girls to the truck
Oh somebody stole my rig somebody stole my rig
Moment quick enjoyment now I'm back on unemployment
Cause somebody stole my rig
Yeah wheels on the cinders and I ran to the windows
And somebody stole my rig
Yeah I tell ya my blackbook was in the glove compartment
That's what really bugs me uh huh
I I din't mind walkin' or losin' my job or anythin'
Somebody stole my rig
I mean they could have borrowed it and ask me before...
