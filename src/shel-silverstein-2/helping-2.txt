Agatha Fry she made a pie
And Christopher John helped bake it
Christopher John he mowed the lawn
And Agatha Fry helped rake it
Now Zachary Zugg took out the rug
And Jennifer Joy helped shake it
Then Jennifer Joy she made a toy
And Zachary Zugg helped break it
And some kind of help is the kind of help
That helping's all about
And some kind of help is the kind of help
We all can do without
