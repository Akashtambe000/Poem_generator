She was dancin' when I seen her in a Mexican cantina
In a neighborhood they call 'La Zona Roja'
She had a child's smile but she told me in a while
It would take a lot of gold to get to know her
Acapulco Goldie donde did you go
You said you'd always hold me
But you run away with me Acapulco Gold
I knew there's no one cuter then she said she was a puta
I said 'What does puta mean?' And she told me...oh no
Then we went to meet a dealer we smoke and drink tequila
Then the lights went out and I guess that's when she rolled me
Just like Acapulco Goldie por que did you go
You said you'd always hold me
But you vamos away with me Acapulco Gold
Ya ya you run away with me Acapulco Gold
