The hard coal's called bituminous
Or is that anthracite
Stalactites grow down from caves
Or do I mean stalagmites
Those fluffy clounds are nimbus 
No  wait  they might be cumulus
And that kid who was raised by wolves 
Was he Remus  or Romulus
The brothauruses ate no meat
Does that mean they're carnivorous
Or were they brontosauruses
And were they herbivorous
A camel is a pachyderm 
Or do I mean dromedary
Is this match inflammable
I thought it was incendiary
Octagons  no hexagons 
No heptagons have seven sides
And don't spray fruit with pesticides 
Or do I mean insecticides
If I can see right through a thing
Is it transparent  or translucent
These are just some of the things
I find confusing...or confuscent
