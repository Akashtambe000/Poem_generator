I knew that she belonged to someone else at the time
But lonesome-lookin' women are a weakness of mine
And so I bought that stuff about the love he never gave her
And I figured I would love her some and do us both a favor
But just when I got up to leave he walked in the door
And I guess I thought he'd be surprised
He looked at me as if to say 'I've been here before'
And he offered me this word to the wise
cho You know she's a cheater son
And you think that you're the one
That's got a lot of what it takes to change her
I've no doubt that you can get her
You ain't much but that don't matter
Nothin' suits her better than a stranger
