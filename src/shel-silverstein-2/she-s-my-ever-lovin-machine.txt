Hey boys you know once I was took in by a girl with a twinkly eye
And the first time that I wasn't lookin' she run off with a handsomer guy oh my
But I'm an ingenious feller yeah as soon as my brain got uncurled
I tiptoed right down to my cellar and I built a mechanical girl
Oh her arms are iron her legs are steel her hips are on wires attached to a wheel
And her spine is a coil that I now and then oil she's my ever-lovin' machine
She has no trouble making her mind up for I did not give her a mind
And her heart is a clock that I wind up so I know that she'll love me in time
Oh she never complains when I stay out all night she never complains I'm not rich
And each time I want her to cuddle me tight I simply turn on her switch
Oh her arms are iron
My love is completely electric and she gives me a shock with each hug
And when the romance gets too hectic I simply pull out the plug
Oh she always did what she was supposed ter right up to this evening but then
She had an affair with the toaster and they ran off and left me again
