I tried on the farmer's hat
Didn't fit…
A little too small  just a bit
Too floppy
Couldn't get used to it
Took it off
I tried on the dancer's shoes
A little too loose
Not the kind you could use
for walkin'
Didn't feel right in 'em
Kicked 'em off
I tried on the summer sun
Felt good
Nice and warm  knew it would
Tried the grass beneath bare feet
Felt neat
Finally finally felt well dressed
Nature's clothes fit me best
