If we meet and I say 'Hi,'
That's a salutation
If you ask me how I feel
That's a consideration
If we stop and talk a while
That's a conversation
If we understand each other
That's a communication
If we argue scream and fight
That's an altercation
If later we apoligize
That's reconciliation
If we help each other home
That's a cooperation
And all these actions added up
Make Civilization
And if I say this is a wonderful poem
Is that exaggeration?
