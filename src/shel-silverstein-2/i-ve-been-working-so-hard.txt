I've been working so hard you just wouldn't believe
And I'm tired
There's so little time and so much to achieve
And I'm tired
I've been lying here holding the grass in its place
Pressing a leaf with the side of my face
Tasting the apples to see if they're sweet
Counting the toes on a centipede's feet
I've been memorizing the shape of that cloud
Warning the robins to not chirp so loud
Shooing the butterflies off the tomatoes
Keeping an eye out for floods and tornadoes
I've been supervising the work of the ants
And thinking of pruning the cantaloupe plants
Calling the fish to swim into my nets
And I've taken twelve thousand and forty-one breaths
And I'm TIRED
