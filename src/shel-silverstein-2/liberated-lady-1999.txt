She’s a liberated lady and she’s lookin’ out for herself
And she don’t need your protection
And she does not want your help
And if you’re lookin’ for some pretty flower
You better go look somewhere else
’Cause I warn you she’s a liberated lady
She got off work at the foundry she was feelin’ kind of beat
On the bus she had to stand and let some fella have her seat
And she pinched the ass of a guy who passed her
Walkin’ down the street
When he called a cop she didn’t quite understand
So she stopped off on the corner for her usual shot of rye
When some guy lit her cigarette she punched him in the eye
Then he kicked her in the balls it was enough to make her cry
But she stood there and she took it like a man
She’s a liberated lady and she smokes them big cigars
You’re gonna find her drinkin’ boilermakers at the corner bar
And in 30 seconds flat she’ll change a flat tire on your car
Look out –– she’s a liberated lady
She come home to find her darlin’ husband cryin’ in distress
She said 'Why ain’t supper ready and why is this house a mess'
He said 'The kids have drove me crazy and I need a brand–new dress
And how come you don’t ever take me dancin’?'
She sat down to smoke her pipe and she thought back to the time
When she was satin silk and lace with nothing on her mind
But now she’s gotta mow the lawn and pay the bills on time
And pray to Mrs God she don’t get drafted
They got into bed that evening and she strapped her dildo on
She climbed on top of him and said 'Ok let’s get it on'
He said 'You know I’ve got my period and my headache isn’t gone '
And he fell asleep –– the chauvinistic bastard
But she’s a liberated lady and she smokes them big cigars
You’re gonna find her drinkin’ boilermakers at the corner bar
And in 30 seconds flat she’ll change a flat tire on your car
Look out –– she’s a liberated lady
