Chorus
Pour me another tequila Sheila
Take off that red satin dress
'Cause I crossed the border
And I beat the dealer for all of that gold in Juarez
I feel like ol' Pancho Villa Sheila
And I've got the pesos to spend
So pour me another tequila Sheila
And lay down and love me again
No I can't tell you about it
Don't mind the gun by my bed
But I feel kind'a naked without it
And it eases the fears in my head
I never trusted in woman
But Sheila I trust you tonight
So pass me the salt and a lemon
Bend down and blow out the light
Chorus
Sheila I'm hearin' your heartbeat
But I'm hearing footsteps outside
The courtyard is crawlin' with them Federales
And Sheila there's no place to hide
but I don't know who could have tipped 'em
nobody knew it but you
but I never have trusted in woman
Sheila here's what I'm going to do
Chorus
Yeah Pour me another tequila
I'm gonna put on your red satin Dress
You put on my clothes and you go face the dealer
Sheila I wish you the best
I never trusted in woman
Sheila I trusted you tonight
So pour me another tequila Sheila
And I'll run for the border again
Yeah Pour me another tequila
Sheila as I ride for the border again
