I'm the Dragon of Grindly Grun
I breathe fire as hot as the sun
When a knight comes to fight
I just toast him on sight
Like a hot crispy cinnamon bun
When I see a fair damsel go by
I just sigh a fiery sigh
And she'd baked like a 'tater
I think of her later
With a romantic tear in my eye
I'm the Dragon of Grindly Grun
But my lunches aren't very much fun
For I like my damsels medium rare
and they always come out well done
