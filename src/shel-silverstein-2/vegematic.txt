Fell asleep last night with the TV on
Oh what a dream I had
Dreamed I went and answered ev'ry single
One of those late night mail order ads
Then four to six weeks later
Much to my surprise
The mailman came to my front door
And I couldn't believe my eyes
He brought the Vegematic
And the Pocket Fisherman too
Illuminated illustrated History of Life
And Box Car Willie with a ginsu knife
A bamboo steamer and a garden weasel too
And a tie dyed day-glow souvenir shirt
From Six Flags Over Burbank
Well the doorbell rang all mornin'
All through the afternoon
And I shook with fright as it rang all night
By the light of the Mastercard moon
There was Federal Express in the pantry
Parcel Post in the hall
COD to the ceiling
And I just couldn't pay for it all
I got an egg scrambler
With a seal-a-meal carryin' case
A set of Presidential Commemorative Plates
So I could eat my eggs off a President's face
A minute mender
And a needle that'll knit or crochet
And an autographed photograph of Rin Tin Tin
At Six Flags Over Burbank
Well I know that I was dreamin'
So I gave a mighty cheer
When I awoke it was no joke
'Cause all that shit was here
So if you fall asleep with the TV on
Let me tell you what to do
Rip the telephone out of the wall
Unless you want this to happen to you
You get Vegematic and the Pocket Fisherman too
Iluminated illustrated History of Life
And Box Car Willie with a ginsu knife
A bamboo steamer and a garden weasel too
And a tie dyed day-glow souvenir shirt
