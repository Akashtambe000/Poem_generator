Come on baby grease your lips
Put on your hat and shake your hips
And don’t forget to bring your ships
We’re goin’ to the Freakers Ball
Shake your mojo bang your gong
Roll up somethin’ to take along
Feels so good that it must be wrong
Freakin’ at the Freakers Ball
All the fags and dykes they’re boogyin’ together
Leather freaks all dressed in leather
The greatest of the sadists and the masochists too
Screamin’ 'You hit me' and 'I’ll hit you'
F.B.I dancin’ with the junkies
All the straights swingin’ with the funkies
’Cross the floor and up the wall
Freakin’ at the Freakers Ball
Hard hats and long hairs lovin’ each other
Brother with sister son with mother
Smear my body up with butter
Take me to the Freakers Ball
So pass that roach pour the wine
I’ll kiss yours and you’ll kiss mine
I’m gonna boogie til I go blind
Freakin’ at the Freakers Ball
