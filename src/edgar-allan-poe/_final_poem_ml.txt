In visions of the dark night
I have dreamed of joy departed
But a waking dream of life and light
Hath left me brokenhearted
Ah what is not a dream by day
To him whose eyes are cast
On things around him with a ray
Turned back upon the past
That holy dream that holy dream
While all the world were chiding
Hath cheered me as a lovely beam
A lonely spirit guiding
What though that light thro storm and night
So trembled from afar
What could there be more purely bright
In Truths daystar
Take this kiss upon the brow
And in parting from you now
Thus much let me avow
You are not wrong who deem
That my days have been a dream
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night or in a day
In a vision or in none
Is it therefore the less gone
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream
I stand amid the roar
Of a surftormented shore
And I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand
How few yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep
While I weep while I weep
O God can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp
O God can I not save
One from the pitiless wave
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream
How shall the burial rite be read
The solemn song be sung
The requiem for the loveliest dead
That ever died so young
II
Her friends are gazing on her
And on her gaudy bier
And weep oh to dishonor
Dead beauty with a tear
III
They loved her for her wealth
And they hated her for her pride
But she grew in feeble health
And they love her that she died
IV
They tell me while they speak
Of her costly broiderd pall
That my voice is growing weak
That I should not sing at all
V
Or that my tone should be
Tund to such solemn song
So mournfully so mournfully
That the dead may feel no wrong
VI
But she is gone above
With young Hope at her side
And I am drunk with love
Of the dead who is my bride
VII
Of the dead dead who lies
All perfumd there
With the death upon her eyes
And the life upon her hair
VIII
Thus on the coffin loud and long
I strike the murmur sent
Through the grey chambers to my song
Shall be the accompaniment
IX
Thou diedst in thy lifes June
But thou didst not die too fair
Thou didst not die too soon
Nor with too calm an air
X
From more than fiends on earth
Thy life and love are riven
To join the untainted mirth
Of more than thrones in heaven
XII
Therefore to thee this night
I will no requiem raise
But waft thee on thy flight
With a PÃ¦an of old days
For her this rhyme is penned whose luminous eyes
Brightly expressive as the twins of Leda
Shall find her own sweet name that nestling lies
Upon the page enwrapped from every reader
Search narrowly the lines they hold a treasure
Divine a talisman an amulet
That must be worn at heart Search well the measure
The words the syllables Do not forget
The trivialest point or you may lose your labor
And yet there is in this no Gordian knot
Which one might not undo without a sabre
If one could merely comprehend the plot
Enwritten upon the leaf where now are peering
Eyes scintillating soul there lie perdus
Three eloquent words oft uttered in the hearing
Of poets by poets as the name is a poets too
Its letters although naturally lying
Like the knight Pinto Mendez Ferdinando
Still form a synonym for Truth Cease trying
You will not read the riddle though you do the best you can do
PART I
O nothing earthly save the ray
Thrown back from flowers of Beautys eye
As in those gardens where the day
Springs from the gems of Circassy
O nothing earthly save the thrill
Of melody in woodland rill
Or music of the passionhearted
Joys voice so peacefully departed
That like the murmur in the shell
Its echo dwelleth and will dwell
Oh nothing of the dross of ours
Yet all the beauty all the flowers
That list our Love and deck our bowers
Adorn yon world afar afar
The wandering star
Twas a sweet time for Nesace for there
Her world lay lolling on the golden air
Near four bright suns a temporary rest
An oasis in desert of the blest
Away away mid seas of rays that roll
Empyrean splendor oer th unchained soul
The soul that scarce the billows are so dense
Can struggle to its destind eminence
To distant spheres from time to time she rode
And late to ours the favord one of God
But now the ruler of an anchord realm
She throws aside the sceptre leaves the helm
And amid incense and high spiritual hymns
Laves in quadruple light her angel limbs
Now happiest loveliest in yon lovely Earth
Whence sprang the Idea of Beauty into birth
Falling in wreaths thro many a startled star
Like womans hair mid pearls until afar
It lit on hills Achaian and there dwelt
She looked into Infinity and knelt
Rich clouds for canopies about her curled
Fit emblems of the model of her world
Seen but in beauty not impeding sight
Of other beauty glittering thro the light
A wreath that twined each starry form around
And all the opald air in color bound
All hurriedly she knelt upon a bed
Of flowers of lilies such as reard the head
On the fair Capo Deucato and sprang
So eagerly around about to hang
Upon the flying footsteps of deep pride
Of her who lovd a mortal and so died
The Sephalica budding with young bees
Upreared its purple stem around her knees
And gemmy flower of Trebizond misnamd
Inmate of highest stars where erst it shamd
All other loveliness its honied dew
The fabled nectar that the heathen knew
Deliriously sweet was droppd from Heaven
And fell on gardens of the unforgiven
In Trebizond and on a sunny flower
So like its own above that to this hour
It still remaineth torturing the bee
With madness and unwonted reverie
In Heaven and all its environs the leaf
And blossom of the fairy plant in grief
Disconsolate linger grief that hangs her head
Repenting follies that full long have Red
Heaving her white breast to the balmy air
Like guilty beauty chastend and more fair
Nyctanthes too as sacred as the light
She fears to perfume perfuming the night
And Clytia pondering between many a sun
While pettish tears adown her petals run
And that aspiring flower that sprang on Earth
And died ere scarce exalted into birth
Bursting its odorous heart in spirit to wing
Its way to Heaven from garden of a king
And Valisnerian lotus thither flown
From struggling with the waters of the Rhone
And thy most lovely purple perfume Zante
Isola doro Fior di Levante
And the Nelumbo bud that floats for ever
With Indian Cupid down the holy river
Fair flowers and fairy to whose care is given
To bear the Goddess song in odors up to Heaven
Spirit that dwellest where
In the deep sky
The terrible and fair
In beauty vie
Beyond the line of blue
The boundary of the star
Which turneth at the view
Of thy barrier and thy bar
Of the barrier overgone
By the comets who were cast
From their pride and from their throne
To be drudges till the last
To be carriers of fire
The red fire of their heart
With speed that may not tire
And with pain that shall not part
Who livest that we know
In Eternity we feel
But the shadow of whose brow
What spirit shall reveal
Tho the beings whom thy Nesace
Thy messenger hath known
Have dreamd for thy Infinity
A model of their own
Thy will is done O God
The star hath ridden high
Thro many a tempest but she rode
Beneath thy burning eye
And here in thought to thee
In thought that can alone
Ascend thy empire and so be
A partner of thy throne
By winged Fantasy
My embassy is given
Till secrecy shall knowledge be
In the environs of Heaven
She ceasd and buried then her burning cheek
Abashd amid the lilies there to seek
A shelter from the fervor of His eye
For the stars trembled at the Deity
She stirrd not breathd not for a voice was there
How solemnly pervading the calm air
A sound of silence on the startled ear
Which dreamy poets name the music of the sphere
Ours is a world of words Quiet we call
Silence which is the merest word of all
All Nature speaks and evn ideal things
Flap shadowy sounds from visionary wings
But ah not so when thus in realms on high
The eternal voice of God is passing by
And the red winds are withering in the sky
What tho in worlds which sightless cycles run
Linked to a little system and one sun
Where all my love is folly and the crowd
Still think my terrors but the thunder cloud
The storm the earthquake and the oceanwrath
Ah will they cross me in my angrier path
What tho in worlds which own a single sun
The sands of Time grow dimmer as they run
Yet thine is my resplendency so given
To bear my secrets thro the upper Heaven
Leave tenantless thy crystal home and fly
With all thy train athwart the moony sky
Apart like fireflies in Sicilian night
And wing to other worlds another light
Divulge the secrets of thy embassy
To the proud orbs that twinkle and so be
To evry heart a barrier and a ban
Lest the stars totter in the guilt of man
Up rose the maiden in the yellow night
The singlemooned eve on Earth we plight
Our faith to one love and one moon adore
The birthplace of young Beauty had no more
As sprang that yellow star from downy hours
Up rose the maiden from her shrine of flowers
And bent oer sheeny mountains and dim plain
Her way but left not yet her Therasaean reign

PART II
High on a mountain of enamelld head
Such as the drowsy shepherd on his bed
Of giant pasturage lying at his ease
Raising his heavy eyelid starts and sees
With many a mutterd hope to be forgiven
What time the moon is quadrated in Heaven
Of rosy head that towering far away
Into the sunlit ether caught the ray
Of sunken suns at eve at noon of night
While the moon dancd with the fair stranger light
Upreard upon such height arose a pile
Of gorgeous columns on th unburthend air
Flashing from Parian marble that twin smile
Far down upon the wave that sparkled there
And nursled the young mountain in its lair
Of molten stars their pavement such as fall
Thro the ebon air besilvering the pall
Of their own dissolution while they die
Adorning then the dwellings of the sky
A dome by linked light from Heaven let down
Sat gently on these columns as a crown
A window of one circular diamond there
Lookd out above into the purple air
And rays from God shot down that meteor chain
And hallowd all the beauty twice again
Save when between th empyrean and that ring
Some eager spirit Flappd his dusky wing
But on the pillars Seraph eyes have seen
The dimness of this world that greyish green
That Nature loves the best Beautys grave
Lurkd in each cornice round each architrave
And every sculpturd cherub thereabout
That from his marble dwelling peered out
Seemd earthly in the shadow of his niche
Achaian statues in a world so rich
Friezes from Tadmor and Persepolis
From Balbec and the stilly clear abyss
Of beautiful Gomorrah O the wave
Is now upon thee but too late to save
Sound loves to revel in a summer night
Witness the murmur of the grey twilight
That stole upon the ear in Eyraco
Of many a wild stargazer long ago
That stealeth ever on the ear of him
Who musing gazeth on the distance dim
And sees the darkness coming as a cloud
Is not its form its voice most palpable and loud
But what is this it cometh and it brings
A music with it tis the rush of wings
A pause and then a sweeping falling strain
And Nesace is in her halls again
From the wild energy of wanton haste
Her cheeks were flushing and her lips apart
And zone that clung around her gentle waist
Had burst beneath the heaving of her heart
Within the centre of that hall to breathe
She paused and panted Zanthe all beneath
The fairy light that kissd her golden hair
And longd to rest yet could but sparkle there
Young flowers were whispering in melody
To happy flowers that night and tree to tree
Fountains were gushing music as they fell
In many a starlit grove or moonlit dell
Yet silence came upon material things
Fair flowers bright waterfalls and angel wings
And sound alone that from the spirit sprang
Bore burthen to the charm the maiden sang
Neath the bluebell or streamer
Or tufted wild spray
That keeps from the dreamer
The moonbeam away
Bright beings that ponder
With half closing eyes
On the stars which your wonder
Hath drawn from the skies
Till they glance thro the shade and
Come down to your brow
Like eyes of the maiden
Who calls on you now
Arise from your dreaming
In violet bowers
To duty beseeming
These starlitten hours
And shake from your tresses
Encumberd with dew
The breath of those kisses
That cumber them too
O how without you Love
Could angels be blest
Those kisses of true Love
That lulld ye to rest
Up shake from your wing
Each hindering thing
The dew of the night
It would weigh down your flight
And true love caresses
O leave them apart
They are light on the tresses
But lead on the heart
Ligeia Ligeia
My beautiful one
Whose harshest idea
Will to melody run
O is it thy will
On the breezes to toss
Or capriciously still
Like the lone Albatros
Incumbent on night
As she on the air
To keep watch with delight
On the harmony there
Ligeia wherever
Thy image may be
No magic shall sever
Thy music from thee
Thou hast bound many eyes
In a dreamy sleep
But the strains still arise
Which thy vigilance keep
The sound of the rain
Which leaps down to the flower
And dances again
In the rhythm of the shower
The murmur that springs
From the growing of grass
Are the music of things
But are modelld alas
Away then my dearest
Oh hie thee away
To the springs that lie clearest
Beneath the moonray
To lone lake that smiles
In its dream of deep rest
At the many starisles
That enjewel its breast
Where wild flowers creeping
Have mingled their shade
On its margin is sleeping
Full many a maid
Some have left the cool glade and
Have slept with the bee
Arouse them my maiden
On moorland and lea
Go breathe on their slumber
All softly in ear
Thy musical number
They slumbered to hear
For what can awaken
An angel so soon
Whose sleep hath been taken
Beneath the cold moon
As the spell which no slumber
Of witchery may test
The rhythmical number
Which lulld him to rest
Spirits in wing and angels to the view
A thousand seraphs burst th Empyrean thro
Young dreams still hovering on their drowsy flight
Seraphs in all but Knowledge the keen light
That fell refracted thro thy bounds afar
O Death from eye of God upon that star
Sweet was that error sweeter still that death
Sweet was that error even with us the breath
Of Science dims the mirror of our joy
To them twere the Simoom and would destroy
For what to them availeth it to know
That Truth is Falsehood or that Bliss is Woe
Sweet was their death with them to die was rife
With the last ecstasy of satiate life
Beyond that death no immortality
But sleep that pondereth and is not to be
And there oh may my weary spirit dwell
Apart from Heavens Eternity and yet how far from Hell
What guilty spirit in what shrubbery dim
Heard not the stirring summons of that hymn
But two they fell for Heaven no grace imparts
To those who hear not for their beating hearts
A maidenangel and her seraphlover
O where and ye may seek the wide skies over
Was Love the blind near sober Duty known
Unguided Love hath fallen mid tears of perfect moan
He was a goodly spirit he who fell
A wanderer by mossymantled well
A gazer on the lights that shine above
A dreamer in the moonbeam by his love
What wonder for each star is eyelike there
And looks so sweetly down on Beautys hair
And they and evry mossy spring were holy
To his lovehaunted heart and melancholy
The night had found to him a night of woe
Upon a mountain crag young Angelo
Beetling it bends athwart the solemn sky
And scowls on starry worlds that down beneath it lie
Here sat he with his love his dark eye bent
With eagle gaze along the firmament
Now turnd it upon her but ever then
It trembled to the orb of EARTH again
Ianthe dearest see how dim that ray
How lovely tis to look so far away
She seemd not thus upon that autumn eve
I left her gorgeous halls nor mournd to leave
That eve that eve I should remember well
The sunray droppd in Lemnos with a spell
On th arabesque carving of a gilded hall
Wherein I sate and on the draperied wall
And on my eyelids O the heavy light
How drowsily it weighd them into night
On flowers before and mist and love they ran
With Persian Saadi in his Gulistan
But O that light I slumberd Death the while
Stole oer my senses in that lovely isle
So softly that no single silken hair
Awoke that slept or knew that he was there
The last spot of Earths orb I trod upon
Was a proud temple calld the Parthenon
More beauty clung around her columnd wall
Than evn thy glowing bosom beats withal
And when old Time my wing did disenthral
Thence sprang I as the eagle from his tower
And years I left behind me in an hour
What time upon her airy bounds I hung
One half the garden of her globe was flung
Unrolling as a chart unto my view
Tenantless cities of the desert too
Ianthe beauty crowded on me then
And half I wishd to be again of men
My Angelo and why of them to be
A brighter dwellingplace is here for thee
And greener fields than in yon world above
And womans loveliness and passionate love
But list Ianthe when the air so soft
Faild as my pennond spirit leapt aloft
Perhaps my brain grew dizzy but the world
I left so late was into chaos hurld
Sprang from her station on the winds apart
And rolld a flame the fiery Heaven athwart
Methought my sweet one then I ceased to soar
And fell not swiftly as I rose before
But with a downward tremulous motion thro
Light brazen rays this golden star unto
Nor long the measure of my falling hours
For nearest of all stars was thine to ours
Dread star that came amid a night of mirth
A red Daedalion on the timid Earth
We came and to thy Earth but not to us
Be given our ladys bidding to discuss
We came my love around above below
Gay firefly of the night we come and go
Nor ask a reason save the angelnod
She grants to us as granted by her God
But Angelo than thine grey Time unfurld
Never his fairy wing Oer fairier world
Dim was its little disk and angel eyes
Alone could see the phantom in the skies
When first Al Aaraaf knew her course to be
Headlong thitherward oer the starry sea
But when its glory swelld upon the sky
As glowing Beautys bust beneath mans eye
We paused before the heritage of men
And thy star trembled as doth Beauty then
Thus in discourse the lovers whiled away
The night that waned and waned and brought no day
They fell for Heaven to them no hope imparts
Who hear not for the beating of their hearts
From childhoods hour I have not been
As others were I have not seen
As others saw I could not bring
My passions from a common spring
From the same source I have not taken
My sorrow I could not awaken
My heart to joy at the same tone
And all I loved I loved alone
Then in my childhood in the dawn
Of a most stormy life was drawn
From every depth of good and ill
The mystery which binds me still
From the torrent or the fountain
From the red cliff of the mountain
From the sun that round me rolled
In its autumn tint of gold
From the lightning in the sky
As it passed me flying by
From the thunder and the storm
And the cloud that took the form
When the rest of Heaven was blue
Of a demon in my view
Elizabeth it is in vain you say
Love not thou sayest it in so sweet a way
In vain those words from thee or L E L
Zantippes talents had enforced so well
Ah if that language from thy heart arise
Breathe it less gently forth and veil thine eyes
Endymion recollect when Luna tried
To cure his love was cured of all beside
His folly pride and passion for he died
Seldom we find says Solomon Don Dunce
Half an idea in the profoundest sonnet
Through all the flimsy things we see at once
As easily as through a Naples bonnet
Trash of all trash how can a lady don it
Yet heavier far than your Petrarchan stuff
Owldowny nonsense that the faintest puff
Twirls into trunkpaper the while you con it
And veritably Sol is right enough
The general tuckermanities are arrant
Bubbles ephemeral and so transparent
But this is now you may depend upon it
Stable opaque immortal all by dint
Of the dear names that he concealed within t
It was many and many a year ago
In a kingdom by the sea
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
By the name of ANNABEL LEE
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love and be loved by me
I was a child and she was a child
In this kingdom by the sea
But we loved with a love that was more than love
I and my Annabel Lee
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
Coveted her and me
And this was the reason that long ago
In this kingdom by the sea
A wind blew out of a cloud chilling
My beautiful Annabel Lee
So that her highborn kinsman came
And bore her away from me
To shut her up in a sepulchre
In this kingdom by the sea
The angels not half so happy in heaven
Went envying her and me
Yes that was the reason as all men know
In this kingdom by the sea
That the wind came out of the cloud by night
Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee
But our love it was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we
Of many far wiser than we
And neither the angels in heaven above
Nor the demons down under the sea
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee
For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee
And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee
And so all the nighttide I lie down by the side
Of my darling my darling my life and my bride
In the sepulchre there by the sea
In her tomb by the sounding sea
The ring is on my hand
And the wreath is on my brow
Satin and jewels grand
Are all at my command
And I am happy now
And my lord he loves me well
But when first he breathed his vow
I felt my bosom swell
For the words rang as a knell
And the voice seemed his who fell
In the battle down the dell
And who is happy now
But he spoke to reassure me
And he kissed my pallid brow
While a reverie came oer me
And to the churchyard bore me
And I sighed to him before me
Thinking him dead DElormie
Oh I am happy now
And thus the words were spoken
And this the plighted vow
And though my faith be broken
And though my heart be broken
Here is a ring as token
That I am happy now
Would God I could awaken
For I dream I know not how
And my soul is sorely shaken
Lest an evil step be taken
Lest the dead who is forsaken
May not be happy now
By a route obscure and lonely
Haunted by ill angels only
Where an Eidolon named NIGHT
On a black throne reigns upright
I have reached these lands but newly
From an ultimate dim Thule
From a wild clime that lieth sublime
Out of SPACE out of TIME
Bottomless vales and boundless floods
And chasms and caves and Titan woods
With forms that no man can discover
For the tears that drip all over
Mountains toppling evermore
Into seas without a shore
Seas that restlessly aspire
Surging unto skies of fire
Lakes that endlessly outspread
Their lone waters lone and dead
Their still waters still and chilly
With the snows of the lolling lily
By the lakes that thus outspread
Their lone waters lone and dead
Their sad waters sad and chilly
With the snows of the lolling lily
By the mountains near the river
Murmuring lowly murmuring ever
By the grey woods by the swamp
Where the toad and the newt encamp
By the dismal tarns and pools
Where dwell the Ghouls
By each spot the most unholy
In each nook most melancholy
There the traveller meets aghast
Sheeted Memories of the Past
Shrouded forms that start and sigh
As they pass the wanderer by
Whiterobed forms of friends long given
In agony to the Earth and Heaven
For the heart whose woes are legion
Tis a peaceful soothing region
For the spirit that walks in shadow
Tis oh tis an Eldorado
But the traveller travelling through it
May not dare not openly view it
Never its mysteries are exposed
To the weak human eye unclosed
So wills its King who hath forbid
The uplifting of the fringed lid
And thus the sad Soul that here passes
Beholds it but through darkened glasses
By a route obscure and lonely
Haunted by ill angels only
Where an Eidolon named NIGHT
On a black throne reigns upright
I have wandered home but newly
From this ultimate dim Thule
Oh that my young life were a lasting dream
My spirit not awakening till the beam
Of an Eternity should bring the morrow
Yes tho that long dream were of hopeless sorrow
Twere better than the cold reality
Of waking life to him whose heart must be
And hath been still upon the lovely earth
A chaos of deep passion from his birth
But should it be that dream eternally
Continuing as dreams have been to me
In my young boyhood should it thus be given
Twere folly still to hope for higher Heaven
For I have revelld when the sun was bright
I the summer sky in dreams of living light
And loveliness have left my very heart
In climes of my imagining apart
From mine own home with beings that have been
Of mine own thought what more could I have seen
Twas once and only once and the wild hour
From my remembrance shall not pass some power
Or spell had bound me twas the chilly wind
Came oer me in the night and left behind
Its image on my spirit or the moon
Shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon
Too coldly or the stars howeer it was
That dream was as that nightwind let it pass
I have been happy tho in a dream
I have been happy and I love the theme
Dreams in their vivid coloring of life
As in that fleeting shadowy misty strife
Of semblance with reality which brings
To the delirious eye more lovely things
Of Paradise and Love and all our own
Than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known
Gaily bedight
A gallant knight
In sunshine and in shadow
Had journeyed long
Singing a song
In search of Eldorado
But he grew old
This knight so bold
And oer his heart a shadow
Fell as he found
No spot of ground
That looked like Eldorado
And as his strength
Failed him at length
He met a pilgrim shadow
Shadow said he
Where can it be
This land of Eldorado
Over the Mountains
Of the Moon
Down the Valley of the Shadow
Ride boldly ride
The shade replied
If you seek for Eldorado
Elizabeth it surely is most fit
Logic and common usage so commanding
In thy own book that first thy name be writ
Zeno and other sages notwithstanding
And I have other reasons for so doing
Besides my innate love of contradiction
Each poet if a poet in pursuing
The muses thro their bowers of Truth or Fiction
Has studied very little of his part
Read nothing written less in shorts a fool
Endued with neither soul nor sense nor art
Being ignorant of one important rule
Employed in even the theses of the school
Called I forget the heathenish Greek name
Called anything its meaning is the same
Always write first things uppermost in the heart
The noblest name in Allegorys page
The hand that traced inexorable rage
A pleasing moralist whose page refined
Displays the deepest knowledge of the mind
A tender poet of a foreign tongue
Indited in the language that he sung
A bard of brilliant but unlicensed page
At once the shame and glory of our age
The prince of harmony and stirling sense
The ancient dramatist of eminence
The bard that paints imaginations powers
And him whose song revives departed hours
Once more an ancient tragic bard recall
In boldness of design surpassing all
These names when rightly read a name make known
Which gathers all their glories in its own
Ill tell you a plan for gaining wealth
Better than banking trade or leases
Take a bank note and fold it up
And then you will find your money in creases
This wonderful plan without danger or loss
Keeps your cash in your hands where nothing can trouble it
And every time that you fold it across
Tis as plain as the light of the day that you double it
I dwelt alone
In a world of moan
And my soul was a stagnant tide
Till the fair and gentle Eulalie became my blushing bride
Till the yellowhaired young Eulalie became my smiling bride
Ah less less bright
The stars of the night
Than the eyes of the radiant girl
That the vapor can make
With the moontints of purple and pearl
Can vie with the modest Eulalies most unregarded curl
Can compare with the brighteyed Eulalies most humble and careless
curl
Now Doubt now Pain
Come never again
For her soul gives me sigh for sigh
And all day long
Shines bright and strong
Astarte within the sky
While ever to her dear Eulalie upturns her matron eye
While ever to her young Eulalie upturns her violet eye
Twas noontide of summer
And midtime of night
And stars in their orbits
Shone pale thro the light
Of the brighter cold moon
Mid planets her slaves
Herself in the Heavens
Her beam on the waves
I gazed awhile
On her cold smile
Too cold too cold for me
There passd as a shroud
A fleecy cloud
And I turned away to thee
Proud Evening Star
In thy glory afar
And dearer thy beam shall be
For joy to my heart
Is the proud part
Thou bearest in Heaven at night
And more I admire
Thy distant fire
Than that colder lowly light
Dim vales and shadowy floods
And cloudylooking woods
Whose forms we cant discover
For the tears that drip all over
Huge moons there wax and wane
Again again again
Every moment of the night
Forever changing places
And they put out the starlight
With the breath from their pale faces
About twelve by the moondial
One more filmy than the rest
A kind which upon trial
They have found to be the best
Comes down still down and down
With its centre on the crown
Of a mountains eminence
While its wide circumference
In easy drapery falls
Over hamlets over halls
Wherever they may be
Oer the strange woods oer the sea
Over spirits on the wing
Over every drowsy thing
And buries them up quite
In a labyrinth of light
And then how deep O deep
Is the passion of their sleep
In the morning they arise
And their moony covering
Is soaring in the skies
With the tempests as they toss
Like almost anything
Or a yellow Albatross
They use that moon no more
For the same end as before
Videlicet a tent
Which I think extravagant
Its atomies however
Into a shower dissever
Of which those butterflies
Of Earth who seek the skies
And so come down again
Nevercontented things
Have brought a specimen
Upon their quivering wings
Thank Heaven the crisis
The danger is past
And the lingering illness
Is over at last
And the fever called Living
Is conquered at last
Sadly I know
I am shorn of my strength
And no muscle I move
As I lie at full length
But no matterI feel
I am better at length
And I rest so composedly
Now in my bed
That any beholder
Might fancy me dead
Might start at beholding me
Thinking me dead
The moaning and groaning
The sighing and sobbing
Are quieted now
With that horrible throbbing
At heart ah that horrible
Horrible throbbing
The sickness the nausea
The pitiless pain
Have ceased with the fever
That maddened my brain
With the fever called Living
That burned in my brain
And oh of all tortures
That torture the worst
Has abated the terrible
Torture of thirst
For the naphthaline river
Of Passion accurst
I have drunk of a water
That quenches all thirst
Of a water that flows
With a lullaby sound
From a spring but a very few
Feet under ground
From a cavern not very far
Down under ground
And ah let it never
Be foolishly said
That my room it is gloomy
And narrow my bed
For man never slept
In a different bed
And to sleep you must slumber
In just such a bed
My tantalized spirit
Here blandly reposes
Forgetting or never
Regretting its roses
Its old agitations
Of myrtles and roses
For now while so quietly
Lying it fancies
A holier odor
About it of pansies
A rosemary odor
Commingled with pansies
With rue and the beautiful
Puritan pansies
And so it lies happily
Bathing in many
A dream of the truth
And the beauty of Annie
Drowned in a bath
Of the tresses of Annie
She tenderly kissed me
She fondly caressed
And then I fell gently
To sleep on her breast
Deeply to sleep
From the heaven of her breast
When the light was extinguished
She covered me warm
And she prayed to the angels
To keep me from harm
To the queen of the angels
To shield me from harm
And I lie so composedly
Now in my bed
Knowing her love
That you fancy me dead
And I rest so contentedly
Now in my bed
With her love at my breast
That you fancy me dead
That you shudder to look at me
Thinking me dead
But my heart it is brighter
Than all of the many
Stars in the sky
For it sparkles with Annie
It glows with the light
Of the love of my Annie
With the thought of the light
Of the eyes of my Annie
Wreathed in myrtle my sword Ill conceal
Like those champions devoted and brave
When they plunged in the tyrant their steel
And to Athens deliverance gave
Beloved heroes your deathless souls roam
In the joy breathing isles of the blest
Where the mighty of old have their home
Where Achilles and Diomed rest
In fresh myrtle my blade Ill entwine
Like Harmodious the gallant and good
When he made at the tutelar shrine
A libation of Tyrannys blood
Ye deliverers of Athens from shame
Ye avengers of Libertys wrongs
Endless ages shall cherish your fame
Embalmed in their echoing songs
At morn at noon at twilight dim
Maria thou hast heard my hymn
In joy and woe in good and ill
Mother of God be with me still
When the hours flew brightly by
And not a cloud obscured the sky
My soul lest it should truant be
Thy grace did guide to thine and thee
Now when storms of Fate oercast
Darkly my Present and my Past
Let my Future radiant shine
With sweet hopes of thee and thine
A dark unfathomed tide
Of interminable pride
A mystery and a dream
Should my early life seem
I say that dream was fraught
With a wild and waking thought
Of beings that have been
Which my spirit hath not seen
Had I let them pass me by
With a dreaming eye
Let none of earth inherit
That vision of my spirit
Those thoughts I would control
As a spell upon his soul
For that bright hope at last
And that light time have past
And my worldly rest hath gone
With a sigh as it passed on
I care not though it perish
With a thought I then did cherish
When from your gems of thought I turn
To those pure orbs your heart to learn
I scarce know which to prize most high
The bright idea or the bright deareye
I
In the greenest of our valleys
By good angels tenanted
Once fair and stately palace
Radiant palace reared its head
In the monarch Thoughts dominion
It stood there
Never seraph spread a pinion
Over fabric half so fair
II
Banners yellow glorious golden
On its roof did float and flow
This all this was in the olden
Time long ago
And every gentle air that dallied
In that sweet day
Along the ramparts plumed and pallid
A winged odour went away
III
Wanderers in that happy valley
Through two luminous windows saw
Spirits moving musically
To a lutes welltuned law
Round about a throne where sitting
Porphyrogene
In state his glory well befitting
The ruler of the realm was seen
IV
And all with pearl and ruby glowing
Was the fair palace door
Through which came flowing flowing flowing
And sparkling evermore
A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty
Was but to sing
In voices of surpassing beauty
The wit and wisdom of their king
V
But evil things in robes of sorrow
Assailed the monarchs high estate
Ah let us mourn for never morrow
Shall dawn upon him desolate
And round about his home the glory
That blushed and bloomed
Is but a dimremembered story
Of the old time entombed
VI
And travellers now within that valley
Through the redlitten windows see
Vast forms that move fantastically
To a discordant melody
While like a rapid ghastly river
Through the pale door
A hideous throng rush out forever
And laugh but smile no more
How often we forget all time when lone
Admiring Natures universal throne
Her woods her winds her mountains the intense
Reply of Hers to Our intelligence
I
In youth I have known one with whom the Earth
In secret communing held as he with it
In daylight and in beauty from his birth
Whose fervid flickering torch of life was lit
From the sun and stars whence he had drawn forth
A passionate light such for his spirit was fit
And yet that spirit knew not in the hour
Of its own fervour what had oer it power
II
Perhaps it may be that my mind is wrought
To a fever by the moonbeam that hangs oer
But I will half believe that wild light fraught
With more of sovereignty than ancient lore
Hath ever told or is it of a thought
The unembodied essence and no more
That with a quickening spell doth oer us pass
As dew of the night time oer the summer grass
III
Doth oer us pass when as th expanding eye
To the loved object so the tear to the lid
Will start which lately slept in apathy
And yet it need not be that object hid
From us in life but common which doth lie
Each hour before us but then only bid
With a strange sound as of a harpstring broken
T awake us Tis a symbol and a token
IV
Of what in other worlds shall be and given
In beauty by our God to those alone
Who otherwise would fall from life and Heaven
Drawn by their hearts passion and that tone
That high tone of the spirit which hath striven
Though not with Faith with godliness whose throne
With desperate energy t hath beaten down
Wearing its own deep feeling as a crown
In Heaven a spirit doth dwell
Whose heartstrings are a lute
None sing so wildly well
As the angel Israfel
And the giddy stars so legends tell
Ceasing their hymns attend the spell
Of his voice all mute
Tottering above
In her highest noon
The enamored moon
Blushes with love
While to listen the red levin
With the rapid Pleiads even
Which were seven
Pauses in Heaven
And they say the starry choir
And the other listening things
That Israfelis fire
Is owing to that lyre
By which he sits and sings
The trembling living wire
Of those unusual strings
But the skies that angel trod
Where deep thoughts are a duty
Where Loves a grownup God
Where the Houri glances are
Imbued with all the beauty
Which we worship in a star
Therefore thou art not wrong
Israfeli who despisest
An unimpassioned song
To thee the laurels belong
Best bard because the wisest
Merrily live and long
The ecstasies above
With thy burning measures suit
Thy grief thy joy thy hate thy love
With the fervor of thy lute
Well may the stars be mute
Yes Heaven is thine but this
Is a world of sweets and sours
Our flowers are merely flowers
And the shadow of thy perfect bliss
Is the sunshine of ours
If I could dwell
Where Israfel
Hath dwelt and he where I
He might not sing so wildly well
A mortal melody
While a bolder note than this might swell
From my lyre within the sky
Ah broken is the golden bowl the spirit flown forever
Let the bell toll a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river
And Guy de Vere hast thou no tear weep now or nevermore
See on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love Lenore
Come let the burial rite be read the funeral song be sung
An anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young
A dirge for her the doubly dead in that she died so young
Wretches ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride
And when she fell in feeble health ye blessed her that she died
How shall the ritual then be read the requiem how be sung
By you by yours the evil eye by yours the slanderous tongue
That did to death the innocence that died and died so young
Peccavimus but rave not thus and let a Sabbath song
Go up to God so solemnly the dead may feel no wrong
The sweet Lenore hath gone before with Hope that flew beside
Leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy
bride
For her the fair and debonair that now so lowly lies
The life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes
The life still there upon her hair the death upon her eyes
Avaunt avaunt from fiends below the indignant ghost is riven
From Hell unto a high estate far up within the Heaven
From grief and groan to a golden throne beside the King of
Heaven
Let no bell toll then lest her soul amid its hallowed mirth
Should catch the note as it doth float up from the damned Earth
And I tonight my heart is light no dirge will I upraise
But waft the angel on her flight with a Paean of old days
Romance who loves to nod and sing
With drowsy head and folded wing
Among the green leaves as they shake
Far down within some shadowy lake
To me a painted paroquet
Hath been a most familiar bird
Taught me my alphabet to say
To lisp my very earliest word
While in the wild wood I did lie
A child with a most knowing eye
Of late eternal Condor years
So shake the very Heaven on high
With tumult as they thunder by
I have no time for idle cares
Through gazing on the unquiet sky
And when an hour with calmer wings
Its down upon my spirit flings
That little time with lyre and rhyme
To while away forbidden things
My heart would feel to be a crime
Unless it trembled with the strings
Sancta Maria turn thine eyes
Upon the sinners sacrifice
Of fervent prayer and humble love
From thy holy throne above
At morn at noon at twilight dim
Maria thou hast heard my hymn
In joy and wo in good and ill
Mother of God be with me still
When the Hours flew brightly by
And not a cloud obscured the sky
My soul lest it should truant be
Thy grace did guide to thine and thee
Now when storms of Fate oercast
Darkly my Present and my Past
Let my Future radiant shine
With sweet hopes of thee and thine
So sweet the hour so calm the time
I feel it more than half a crime
When Nature sleeps and stars are mute
To mar the silence evn with lute
At rest on oceans brilliant dyes
An image of Elysium lies
Seven Pleiades entranced in Heaven
Form in the deep another seven
Endymion nodding from above
Sees in the sea a second love
Within the valleys dim and brown
And on the spectral mountains crown
The wearied light is dying down
And earth and stars and sea and sky
Are redolent of sleep as I
Am redolent of thee and thine
Enthralling love my Adeline
But list O list so soft and low
Thy lovers voice tonight shall flow
That scarce awake thy soul shall deem
My words the music of a dream
Thus while no single sound too rude
Upon thy slumber shall intrude
Our thoughts our souls O God above
In every deed shall mingle love
I saw thee on thy bridal day
When a burning blush came oer thee
Though happiness around thee lay
The world all love before thee
And in thine eye a kindling light
Whatever it might be
Was all on Earth my aching sight
Of Loveliness could see
That blush perhaps was maiden shame
As such it well may pass
Though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame
In the breast of him alas
Who saw thee on that bridal day
When that deep blush would come oer thee
Though happiness around thee lay
The world all love before thee
There are some qualities some incorporate things
That have a double life which thus is made
A type of that twin entity which springs
From matter and light evinced in solid and shade
There is a twofold Silence sea and shore
Body and soul One dwells in lonely places
Newly with grass oergrown some solemn graces
Some human memories and tearful lore
Render him terrorless his names No More
He is the corporate Silence dread him not
No power hath he of evil in himself
But should some urgent fate untimely lot
Bring thee to meet his shadow nameless elf
That haunteth the lone regions where hath trod
No foot of man commend thyself to God
Science true daughter of Old Time thou art
Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes
Why preyest thou thus upon the poets heart
Vulture whose wings are dull realities
How should he love thee or how deem thee wise
Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering
To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies
Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing
Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car
And driven the Hamadryad from the wood
To seek a shelter in some happier star
Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood
The Elfin from the green grass and from me
The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree
Fair isle that from the fairest of all flowers
Thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take
How many memories of what radiant hours
At sight of thee and thine at once awake
How many scenes of what departed bliss
How many thoughts of what entombed hopes
How many visions of a maiden that is
No more no more upon thy verdant slopes
No more alas that magical sad sound
Transforming all Thy charms shall please no more
Thy memory no more Accursed ground
Henceforth I hold thy flowerenameled shore
O hyacinthine isle O purple Zante
Isola doro Fior di Levante
Thy soul shall find itself alone
Mid dark thoughts of the grey tombstone
Not one of all the crowd to pry
Into thine hour of secrecy
Be silent in that solitude
Which is not loneliness for then
The spirits of the dead who stood
In life before thee are again
In death around thee and their will
Shall overshadow thee be still
The night though clear shall frown
And the stars shall not look down
From their high thrones in the Heaven
With light like hope to mortals given
But their red orbs without beam
To thy weariness shall seem
As a burning and a fever
Which would cling to thee for ever
Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish
Now are visions neer to vanish
From thy spirit shall they pass
No more like dewdrop from the grass
The breeze the breath of God is still
And the mist upon the hill
Shadowy shadowy yet unbroken
Is a symbol and a token
How it hangs upon the trees
A mystery of mysteries
How often we forget all time when lone
Admiring Natures universal throne
Her woods her wilds her mountains the intense

That high tone of the spirit which hath striven
Tho not with Faith with godliness whose throne

Wearing its own deep feeling as a crown
Kind solace in a dying hour
Such father is not now my theme
I will not madly deem that power
Of Earth may shrive me of the sin
Unearthly pride hath revelld in
I have no time to dote or dream
You call it hope that fire of fire
It is but agony of desire
If I can hope Oh God I can
Its fount is holier more divine
I would not call thee fool old man
But such is not a gift of thine
Know thou the secret of a spirit
Bowd from its wild pride into shame
O yearning heart I did inherit
Thy withering portion with the fame
The searing glory which hath shone
Amid the jewels of my throne
Halo of Hell and with a pain
Not Hell shall make me fear again
O craving heart for the lost flowers
And sunshine of my summer hours
The undying voice of that dead time
With its interminable chime
Rings in the spirit of a spell
Upon thy emptiness a knell
I have not always been as now
The feverd diadem on my brow
I claimd and won usurpingly
Hath not the same fierce heirdom given
Rome to the Caesar this to me
The heritage of a kingly mind
And a proud spirit which hath striven
Triumphantly with human kind
On mountain soil I first drew life
The mists of the Taglay have shed
Nightly their dews upon my head
And I believe the winged strife
And tumult of the headlong air
Have nestled in my very hair
So late from Heaven that dew it fell
Mid dreams of an unholy night
Upon me with the touch of Hell
While the red flashing of the light
From clouds that hung like banners oer
Appeared to my halfclosing eye
The pageantry of monarchy
And the deep trumpetthunders roar
Came hurriedly upon me telling
Of human battle where my voice
My own voice silly child was swelling
O how my spirit would rejoice
And leap within me at the cry
The battlecry of Victory
The rain came down upon my head
Unshelterd and the heavy wind
Rendered me mad and deaf and blind
It was but man I thought who shed
Laurels upon me and the rush
The torrent of the chilly air
Gurgled within my ear the crush
Of empires with the captives prayer
The hum of suitors and the tone
Of flattery round a sovereigns throne
My passions from that hapless hour
Usurpd a tyranny which men
Have deemd since I have reachd to power
My innate nature be it so
But father there livd one who then
Then in my boyhood when their fire
Burnd with a still intenser glow
For passion must with youth expire
Een then who knew this iron heart
In womans weakness had a part
I have no words alas to tell
The loveliness of loving well
Nor would I now attempt to trace
The more than beauty of a face
Whose lineaments upon my mind
Are shadows on th unstable wind
Thus I remember having dwelt
Some page of early lore upon
With loitering eye till I have felt
The letters with their meaning melt
To fantasies with none
O she was worthy of all love
Love as in infancy was mine
Twas such as angel minds above
Might envy her young heart the shrine
On which my every hope and thought
Were incense then a goodly gift
For they were childish and upright
Pure as her young example taught
Why did I leave it and adrift
Trust to the fire within for light
We grew in age and love together
Roaming the forest and the wild
My breast her shield in wintry weather
And when the friendly sunshine smild
And she would mark the opening skies
I saw no Heaven but in her eyes
Young Loves first lesson is the heart
For mid that sunshine and those smiles
When from our little cares apart
And laughing at her girlish wiles
Id throw me on her throbbing breast
And pour my spirit out in tears
There was no need to speak the rest
No need to quiet any fears
Of her who askd no reason why
But turnd on me her quiet eye
Yet more than worthy of the love
My spirit struggled with and strove
When on the mountain peak alone
Ambition lent it a new tone
I had no being but in thee
The world and all it did contain
In the earth the air the sea
Its joy its little lot of pain
That was new pleasure the ideal
Dim vanities of dreams by night
And dimmer nothings which were real
Shadows and a more shadowy light
Parted upon their misty wings
And so confusedly became
Thine image and a name a name
Two separate yet most intimate things
I was ambitious have you known
The passion father You have not
A cottager I markd a throne
Of half the world as all my own
And murmurd at such lowly lot
But just like any other dream
Upon the vapour of the dew
My own had past did not the beam
Of beauty which did while it thro
The minute the hour the day oppress
My mind with double loveliness
We walkd together on the crown
Of a high mountain which lookd down
Afar from its proud natural towers
Of rock and forest on the hills
The dwindled hills begirt with bowers
And shouting with a thousand rills
I spoke to her of power and pride
But mystically in such guise
That she might deem it nought beside
The moments converse in her eyes
I read perhaps too carelessly
A mingled feeling with my own
The flush on her bright cheek to me
Seemd to become a queenly throne
Too well that I should let it be
Light in the wilderness alone
I wrappd myself in grandeur then
And donnd a visionary crown
Yet it was not that Fantasy
Had thrown her mantle over me
But that among the rabble men
Lion ambition is chained down
And crouches to a keepers hand
Not so in deserts where the grand
The wild the terrible conspire
With their own breath to fan his fire
Look round thee now on Samarcand
Is not she queen of Earth her pride
Above all cities in her hand
Their destinies in all beside
Of glory which the world hath known
Stands she not nobly and alone
Falling her veriest steppingstone
Shall form the pedestal of a throne
And who her sovereign Timour he
Whom the astonished people saw
Striding oer empires haughtily
A diademd outlaw
O human love thou spirit given
On Earth of all we hope in Heaven
Which fallst into the soul like rain
Upon the Sirocwitherd plain
And failing in thy power to bless
But leavst the heart a wilderness
Idea which bindest life around
With music of so strange a sound
And beauty of so wild a birth
Farewell for I have won the Earth
When Hope the eagle that towerd could see
No cliff beyond him in the sky
His pinions were bent droopingly
And homeward turnd his softend eye
Twas sunset when the sun will part
There comes a sullenness of heart
To him who still would look upon
The glory of the summer sun
That soul will hate the evning mist
So often lovely and will list
To the sound of the coming darkness known
To those whose spirits hearken as one
Who in a dream of night would fly
But cannot from a danger nigh
What tho the moon the white moon
Shed all the splendour of her noon
Her smile is chilly and her beam
In that time of dreariness will seem
So like you gather in your breath
A portrait taken after death
And boyhood is a summer sun
Whose waning is the dreariest one
For all we live to know is known
And all we seek to keep hath flown
Let life then as the dayflower fall
With the noonday beauty which is all
I reachd my home my home no more
For all had flown who made it so
I passd from out its mossy door
And tho my tread was soft and low
A voice came from the threshold stone
Of one whom I had earlier known
O I defy thee Hell to show
On beds of fire that burn below
A humbler heart a deeper woe
Father I firmly do believe
I know for Death who comes for me
From regions of the blest afar
Where there is nothing to deceive
Hath left his iron gate ajar
And rays of truth you cannot see
Are flashing thro Eternity
I do believe that Eblis hath
A snare in every human path
Else how when in the holy grove
I wandered of the idol Love
Who daily scents his snowy wings
With incense of burnt offerings
From the most unpolluted things
Whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven
Above with trellisd rays from Heaven
No mote may shun no tiniest fly
The lightning of his eagle eye
How was it that Ambition crept
Unseen amid the revels there
Till growing bold he laughed and leapt
In the tangles of Loves very hair
I
Hear the sledges with the bells
Silver bells
What a world of merriment their melody foretells
How they tinkle tinkle tinkle
In the icy air of night
While the stars that oversprinkle
All the heavens seem to twinkle
With a crystalline delight
Keeping time time time
In a sort of Runic rhyme
To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells
From the bells bells bells bells
Bells bells bells
From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells
II
Hear the mellow wedding bells
Golden bells
What a world of happiness their harmony foretells
Through the balmy air of night
How they ring out their delight
From the moltengolden notes
And an in tune
What a liquid ditty floats
To the turtledove that listens while she gloats
On the moon
Oh from out the sounding cells
What a gush of euphony voluminously wells
How it swells
How it dwells
On the Future how it tells
Of the rapture that impels
To the swinging and the ringing
Of the bells bells bells
Of the bells bells bellsbells
Bells bells bells
To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells
III
Hear the loud alarum bells
Brazen bells
What a tale of terror now their turbulency tells
In the startled ear of night
How they scream out their affright
Too much horrified to speak
They can only shriek shriek
Out of tune
In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire
In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire
Leaping higher higher higher
With a desperate desire
And a resolute endeavor
Now now to sit or never
By the side of the palefaced moon
Oh the bells bells bells
What a tale their terror tells
Of Despair
How they clang and clash and roar
What a horror they outpour
On the bosom of the palpitating air
Yet the ear it fully knows
By the twanging
And the clanging
How the danger ebbs and flows
Yet the ear distinctly tells
In the jangling
And the wrangling
How the danger sinks and swells
By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells
Of the bells
Of the bells bells bellsbells
Bells bells bells
In the clamor and the clangor of the bells
IV
Hear the tolling of the bells
Iron Bells
What a world of solemn thought their monody compels
In the silence of the night
How we shiver with affright
At the melancholy menace of their tone
For every sound that floats
From the rust within their throats
Is a groan
And the people ah the people
They that dwell up in the steeple
All Alone
And who tolling tolling tolling
In that muffled monotone
Feel a glory in so rolling
On the human heart a stone
They are neither man nor woman
They are neither brute nor human
They are Ghouls
And their king it is who tolls
And he rolls rolls rolls
Rolls
A paean from the bells
And his merry bosom swells
With the paean of the bells
And he dances and he yells
Keeping time time time
In a sort of Runic rhyme
To the paean of the bells
Of the bells
Keeping time time time
In a sort of Runic rhyme
To the throbbing of the bells
Of the bells bells bells
To the sobbing of the bells
Keeping time time time
As he knells knells knells
In a happy Runic rhyme
To the rolling of the bells
Of the bells bells bells
To the tolling of the bells
Of the bells bells bells bells
Bells bells bells
To the moaning and the groaning of the bells
The bells ah the bells
The little silver bells
How fairylike a melody there floats
From their throats
From their merry little throats
From the silver tinkling throats
Of the bells bells bells
Of the bells
The bells ah the bells
The heavy iron bells
How horrible a monody there floats
From their throats
From their deeptoned throats
From their melancholy throats
How I shudder at the notes
Of the bells bells bells
Of the bells
Lo Death has reared himself a throne
In a strange city lying alone
Far down within the dim West
Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best
Have gone to their eternal rest
There shrines and palaces and towers
Timeeaten towers that tremble not
Resemble nothing that is ours
Around by lifting winds forgot
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters he
No rays from the holy heaven come down
On the long nighttime of that town
But light from out the lurid sea
Streams up the turrets silently
Gleams up the pinnacles far and free
Up domes up spires up kingly halls
Up fanes up Babylonlike walls
Up shadowy longforgotten bowers
Of sculptured ivy and stone flowers
Up many and many a marvellous shrine
Whose wreathed friezes intertwine
The viol the violet and the vine
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie
So blend the turrets and shadows there
That all seem pendulous in air
While from a proud tower in the town
Death looks gigantically down
There open fanes and gaping graves
Yawn level with the luminous waves
But not the riches there that lie
In each idols diamond eye
Not the gailyjewelled dead
Tempt the waters from their bed
For no ripples curl alas
Along that wilderness of glass
No swellings tell that winds may be
Upon some faroff happier sea
No heavings hint that winds have been
On seas less hideously serene
But lo a stir is in the air
The wave there is a movement there
As if the towers had thrust aside
In slightly sinking the dull tide
As if their tops had feebly given
A void within the filmy Heaven
The waves have now a redder glow
The hours are breathing faint and low
And when amid no earthly moans
Down down that town shall settle hence
Hell rising from a thousand thrones
Shall do it reverence
LO Death hath reard himself a throne
In a strange city all alone
Far down within the dim west
Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best
Have gone to their eternal rest

There shrines and palaces and towers
Are not like any thing of ours
Oh no O no ours never loom
To heaven with that ungodly gloom
Timeeaten towers that tremble not
Resemble nothing that is ours
Around by lifting winds forgot
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie

No holy rays from heaven come down
On the long nighttime of that town
But light from out the lurid sea
Streams up the turrets silently
Up thrones up longforgotten bowers
Of sculturd ivy and stone flowers
Up domes up spires up kingly halls
Up fanes up Babylonlike walls
Up many a melancholy shrine
Whose entablatures intertwine
The mask the viol and the vine

There open temples open graves
Are on a level with the waves
But not the riches there that lie
In each idols diamond eye
Not the gailyjewelld dead
Tempt the waters from their bed
For no ripples curl alas
Along that wilderness of glass
No swellings hint that winds may be
Upon a faroff happier sea
So blend the turrets and shadows there
That all seem pendulous in air
While from the high towers of the town
Death looks gigantically down

But lo a stir is in the air
The wave there is a ripple there
As if the towers had thrown aside
In slightly sinking the dull tide
As if the turrettops had given
A vacuum in the filmy heaven
The waves have now a redder glow
The very hours are breathing low
And when amid no earthly moans
Down down that town shall settle hence
All Hades from a thousand thrones
Shall do it reverence
And Death to some more happy clime
Shall give his undivided time
Type of the antique Rome Rich reliquary
Of lofty contemplation left to Time
By buried centuries of pomp and power
At length at length after so many days
Of weary pilgrimage and burning thirst
Thirst for the springs of lore that in thee lie
I kneel an altered and an humble man
Amid thy shadows and so drink within
My very soul thy grandeur gloom and glory
Vastness and Age and Memories of Eld
Silence and Desolation and dim Night
I feel ye now I feel ye in your strength
O spells more sure than eer Judaean king
Taught in the gardens of Gethsemane
O charms more potent than the rapt Chaldee
Ever drew down from out the quiet stars
Here where a hero fell a column falls
Here where the mimic eagle glared in gold
A midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat
Here where the dames of Rome their gilded hair
Waved to the wind now wave the reed and thistle
Here where on golden throne the monarch lolled
Glides spectrelike unto his marble home
Lit by the wan light of the horned moon
The swift and silent lizard of the stones
But stay these walls these ivyclad arcades
These moldering plinths these sad and blackened shafts
These vague entablatures this crumbling frieze
These shattered cornices this wreck this ruin
These stones alas these grey stones are they all
All of the famed and the colossal left
By the corrosive Hours to Fate and me
Not all the Echoes answer me not all
Prophetic sounds and loud arise forever
From us and from all Ruin unto the wise
As melody from Memnon to the Sun
We rule the hearts of mightiest men we rule
With a despotic sway all giant minds
We are not impotent we pallid stones
Not all our power is gone not all our fame
Not all the magic of our high renown
Not all the wonder that encircles us
Not all the mysteries that in us lie
Not all the memories that hang upon
And cling around about us as a garment
Clothing us in a robe of more than glory
Lo tis a gala night
Within the lonesome latter years
An angel throng bewinged bedight
In veils and drowned in tears
Sit in a theatre to see
A play of hopes and fears
While the orchestra breathes fitfully
The music of the spheres
Mimes in the form of God on high
Mutter and mumble low
And hither and thither fly
Mere puppets they who come and go
At bidding of vast formless things
That shift the scenery to and fro
Flapping from out their Condor wings
Invisible Woe
That motley drama oh be sure
It shall not be forgot
With its Phantom chased for evermore
By a crowd that seize it not
Through a circle that ever returneth in
To the selfsame spot
And much of Madness and more of Sin
And Horror the soul of the plot
But see amid the mimic rout
A crawling shape intrude
A bloodred thing that writhes from out
The scenic solitude
It writhes it writhes with mortal pangs
The mimes become its food
And seraphs sob at vermin fangs
In human gore imbued
Out out are the lights out all
And over each quivering form
The curtain a funeral pall
Comes down with the rush of a storm
While the angels all pallid and wan
Uprising unveiling affirm
That the play is the tragedy Man
And its hero the Conqueror Worm
The only king by right divine
Is Ellen King and were she mine
Id strive for liberty no more
But hug the glorious chains I wore
Her bosom is an ivory throne
Where tyrant virtue reigns alone
No subject vice dare interfere
To check the power that governs here
O would she deign to rule my fate
Id worship Kings and kingly state
And hold this maxim all life long
The King my King can do no wrong
Tis said that when
The hands of men
Tamed this primeval wood
And hoary trees with groans of woe
Like warriors by an unknown foe
Were in their strength subdued
The virgin Earth Gave instant birth
To springs that neer did flow
That in the sun Did rivulets run
And all around rare flowers did blow
The wild rose pale Perfumed the gale
And the queenly lily adown the dale
Whom the sun and the dew
And the winds did woo
With the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew
So when in tears
The love of years
Is wasted like the snow
And the fine fibrils of its life
By the rude wrong of instant strife
Are broken at a blow
Within the heart
Do springs upstart
Of which it doth now know
And strange sweet dreams
Like silent streams
That from new fountains overflow
With the earlier tide
Of rivers glide
Deep in the heart whose hope has died
Quenching the fires its ashes hide
Its ashes whence will spring and grow
Sweet flowers ere long
The rare and radiant flowers of song
The happiest day the happiest hour
My seard and blighted heart hath known
The highest hope of pride and power
I feel hath flown
Of power said I yes such I ween
But they have vanishd long alas
The visions of my youth have been
But let them pass
And pride what have I now with thee
Another brow may even inherit
The venom thou hast pourd on me
Be still my spirit
The happiest day the happiest hour
Mine eyes shall see have ever seen
The brightest glance of pride and power
I feel have been
But were that hope of pride and power
Now offerd with the pain
Even then I felt that brightest hour
I would not live again
For on its wing was dark alloy
And as it flutterd fell
An essence powerful to destroy
A soul that knew it well
In the greenest of our valleys
By good angels tenanted
Once a fair and stately palace
Radiant palace reared its head
In the monarch Thoughts dominion
It stood there
Never seraph spread a pinion
Over fabric half so fair
Banners yellow glorious golden
On its roof did float and flow
This all this was in the olden
Time long ago
And every gentle air that dallied
In that sweet day
Along the ramparts plumed and pallid
A winged odor went away
Wanderers in that happy valley
Through two luminous windows saw
Spirits moving musically
To a lutes welltuned law
Round about a throne where sitting
Porphyrogene
In state his glory wellbefitting
The ruler of the realm was seen
And all with pearl and ruby glowing
Was the fair palace door
Through which came flowing flowing flowing
And sparkling evermore
A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty
Was but to sing
In voices of surpassing beauty
The wit and wisdom of their king
But evil things in robes of sorrow
Assailed the monarchs high estate
Ah let us mourn for never morrow
Shall dawn upon him desolate
And round about his home the glory
That blushed and bloomed
Is but a dimremembered story
Of the old time entombed
And travellers now within that valley
Through the redlitten windows see
Vast forms that move fantastically
To a discordant melody
While like a ghastly rapid river
Through the pale door
A hideous throng rush out forever
And laugh but smile no more
THE END

In spring of youth it was my lot
To haunt of the wide world a spot
The which I could not love the less
So lovely was the loneliness
Of a wild lake with black rock bound
And the tall pines that towered around
But when the Night had thrown her pall
Upon that spot as upon all
And the mystic wind went by
Murmuring in melody
Then ah then I would awake
To the terror of the lone lake
Yet that terror was not fright
But a tremulous delight
A feeling not the jewelled mine
Could teach or bribe me to define
Nor Love although the Love were thine
Death was in that poisonous wave
And in its gulf a fitting grave
For him who thence could solace bring
To his lone imagining
Whose solitary soul could make
An Eden of that dim lake
Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered weak and weary
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore
While I nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping
As of some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber door
Tis some visitor I muttered tapping at my chamber door
Only this and nothing more
Ah distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
Eagerly I wished the morrow vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow sorrow for the lost Lenore
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore
Nameless here for evermore
And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before
So that now to still the beating of my heart I stood repeating
Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door
This it is and nothing more
Presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer
Sir said I or Madam truly your forgiveness I implore
But the fact is I was napping and so gently you came rapping
And so faintly you came tapping tapping at my chamber door
That I scarce was sure I heard you here I opened wide the door
Darkness there and nothing more
Deep into that darkness peering long I stood there wondering
fearing
Doubting dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before
But the silence was unbroken and the stillness gave no token
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word Lenore
This I whispered and an echo murmured back the word Lenore
Merely this and nothing more
Back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before
Surely said I surely that is something at my window lattice
Let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore
Tis the wind and nothing more
Open here I flung the shutter when with many a flirt and
flutter
In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore
Not the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed
he
But with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door
Perched and sat and nothing more
Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore
Though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou I said art sure no
craven
Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Nights Plutonian shore
Quoth the Raven Nevermore
Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly
Though its answer little meaning little relevancy bore
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door
With such name as Nevermore
But the raven sitting lonely on the placid bust spoke only
That one word as if his soul in that one word he did outpour
Nothing further then he uttered not a feather then he fluttered
Till I scarcely more than muttered other friends have flown
before
On the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before
Then the bird said Nevermore
Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken
Doubtless said I what it utters is its only stock and store
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
Of Never nevermore
But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and
door
Then upon the velvet sinking I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore
What this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore
Meant in croaking Nevermore
This I sat engaged in guessing but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms core
This and more I sat divining with my head at ease reclining
On the cushions velvet lining that the lamplight gloated oer
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating oer
She shall press ah nevermore
Then methought the air grew denser perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor
Wretch I cried thy God hath lent thee by these angels he
hath sent thee
Respite respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore
Quaff oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore
Quoth the Raven Nevermore
Prophet said I thing of evil prophet still if bird or
devil
Whether Tempter sent or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore
Desolate yet all undaunted on this desert land enchanted
On this home by horror haunted tell me truly I implore
Is there is there balm in Gilead tell me tell me I implore
Quoth the Raven Nevermore
Prophet said I thing of evil prophet still if bird or
devil
By that Heaven that bends above us by that God we both adore
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if within the distant Aidenn
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore
Quoth the Raven Nevermore
Be that word our sign in parting bird or fiend I shrieked
upstarting
Get thee back into the tempest and the Nights Plutonian shore
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken
Leave my loneliness unbroken quit the bust above my door
Take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my
door
Quoth the Raven Nevermore
And the Raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming
And the lamplight oer him streaming throws his shadow on the
floor
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifted nevermore
At midnight in the month of June
I stand beneath the mystic moon
An opiate vapor dewy dim
Exhales from out her golden rim
And softly dripping drop by drop
Upon the quiet mountain top
Steals drowsily and musically
Into the universal valley
The rosemary nods upon the grave
The lily lolls upon the wave
Wrapping the fog about its breast
The ruin molders into rest
Looking like Lethe see the lake
A conscious slumber seems to take
And would not for the world awake
All Beauty sleeps and lo where lies
Irene with her Destinies
O lady bright can it be right
This window open to the night
The wanton airs from the treetop
Laughingly through the lattice drop
The bodiless airs a wizard rout
Flit through thy chamber in and out
And wave the curtain canopy
So fitfully so fearfully
Above the closed and fringed lid
Neath which thy slumbring soul lies hid
That oer the floor and down the wall
Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall
Oh lady dear hast thou no fear
Why and what art thou dreaming here
Sure thou art come Oer faroff seas
A wonder to these garden trees
Strange is thy pallor strange thy dress
Strange above all thy length of tress
And this all solemn silentness
The lady sleeps Oh may her sleep
Which is enduring so be deep
Heaven have her in its sacred keep
This chamber changed for one more holy
This bed for one more melancholy
I pray to God that she may lie
For ever with unopened eye
While the pale sheeted ghosts go by
My love she sleeps Oh may her sleep
As it is lasting so be deep
Soft may the worms about her creep
Far in the forest dim and old
For her may some tall vault unfold
Some vault that oft has flung its black
And winged panels fluttering back
Triumphant oer the crested palls
Of her grand family funerals
Some sepulchre remote alone
Against whose portal she hath thrown
In childhood many an idle stone
Some tomb from out whose sounding door
She neer shall force an echo more
Thrilling to think poor child of sin
It was the dead who groaned within
Once it smiled a silent dell
Where the people did not dwell
They had gone unto the wars
Trusting to the mildeyed stars
Nightly from their azure towers
To keep watch above the flowers
In the midst of which all day
The red sunlight lazily lay
Now each visitor shall confess
The sad valleys restlessness
Nothing there is motionless
Nothing save the airs that brood
Over the magic solitude
Ah by no wind are stirred those trees
That palpitate like the chill seas
Around the misty Hebrides
Ah by no wind those clouds are driven
That rustle through the unquiet Heaven
Uneasily from morn till even
Over the violets there that lie
In myriad types of the human eye
Over the lilies there that wave
And weep above a nameless grave
They wave from out their fragrant tops
Eternal dews come down in drops
They weep from off their delicate stems
Perennial tears descend in gems
In these rapid restless shadows
Once I walked at eventide
When a gentle silent maiden
Walked in beauty at my side
She alone there walked beside me
All in beauty like a bride
Pallidly the moon was shining
On the dewy meadows nigh
On the silvery silent rivers
On the mountains far and high
On the oceans starlit waters
Where the winds aweary die
Slowly silently we wandered
From the open cottage door
Underneath the elms long branches
To the pavement bending oer
Underneath the mossy willow
And the dying sycamore
With the myriad stars in beauty
All bedight the heavens were seen
Radiant hopes were bright around me
Like the light of stars serene
Like the mellow midnight splendor
Of the Nights irradiate queen
Audibly the elmleaves whispered
Peaceful pleasant melodies
Like the distant murmured music
Of unquiet lovely seas
While the winds were hushed in slumber
In the fragrant flowers and trees
Wondrous and unwonted beauty
Still adorning all did seem
While I told my love in fables
Neath the willows by the stream
Would the heart have kept unspoken
Love that was its rarest dream
Instantly away we wandered
In the shadowy twilight tide
She the silent scornful maiden
Walking calmly at my side
With a step serene and stately
All in beauty all in pride
Vacantly I walked beside her
On the earth mine eyes were cast
Swift and keen there came unto me
Bitter memories of the past
On me like the rain in Autumn
On the dead leaves cold and fast
Underneath the elms we parted
By the lowly cottage door
One brief word alone was uttered
Never on our lips before
And away I walked forlornly
Brokenhearted evermore
Slowly silently I loitered
Homeward in the night alone
Sudden anguish bound my spirit
That my youth had never known
Wild unrest like that which cometh
When the Nights first dream hath flown
Now to me the elmleaves whisper
Mad discordant melodies
And keen melodies like shadows
Haunt the moaning willow trees
And the sycamores with laughter
Mock me in the nightly breeze
Sad and pale the Autumn moonlight
Through the sighing foliage streams
And each morning midnight shadow
Shadow of my sorrow seems
Strive O heart forget thine idol
And O soul forget thy dreams
Not long ago the writer of these lines
In the mad pride of intellectuality
Maintained the power of words denied that ever
A thought arose within the human brain
Beyond the utterance of the human tongue
And now as if in mockery of that boast
Two words two foreign soft dissyllables
Italian tones made only to be murmured
By angels dreaming in the moonlit dew
That hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill
Have stirred from out the abysses of his heart
Unthoughtlike thoughts that are the souls of thought
Richer far wilder far diviner visions
Than even seraph harper Israfel
Who has the sweetest voice of all Gods creatures
Could hope to utter And I my spells are broken
The pen falls powerless from my shivering hand
With thy dear name as text though bidden by thee
I cannot write I cannot speak or think
Alas I cannot feel for tis not feeling
This standing motionless upon the golden
Threshold of the wideopen gate of dreams
Gazing entranced adown the gorgeous vista
And thrilling as I see upon the right
Upon the left and all the way along
Amid empurpled vapors far away
To where the prospect terminates thee only
Thou wouldst be loved then let thy heart
From its present pathway part not
Being everything which now thou art
Be nothing which thou art not
So with the world thy gentle ways
Thy grace thy more than beauty
Shall be an endless theme of praise
And love a simple duty
Beloved amid the earnest woes
That crowd around my earthly path
Drear path alas where grows
Not even one lonely rose
My soul at least a solace hath
In dreams of thee and therein knows
An Eden of bland repose
And thus thy memory is to me
Like some enchanted faroff isle
In some tumultuous sea
Some ocean throbbing far and free
With storms but where meanwhile
Serenest skies continually
Just oer that one bright island smile
I saw thee once once only years ago
I must not say how many but not many
It was a July midnight and from out
A fullorbed moon that like thine own soul soaring
Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven
There fell a silverysilken veil of light
With quietude and sultriness and slumber
Upon the upturned faces of a thousand
Roses that grew in an enchanted garden
Where no wind dared to stir unless on tiptoe
Fell on the upturnd faces of these roses
That gave out in return for the lovelight
Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death
Fell on the upturnd faces of these roses
That smiled and died in this parterre enchanted
By thee and by the poetry of thy presence
Clad all in white upon a violet bank
I saw thee half reclining while the moon
Fell on the upturnd faces of the roses
And on thine own upturnd alas in sorrow
Was it not Fate that on this July midnight
Was it not Fate whose name is also Sorrow
That bade me pause before that gardengate
To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses
No footstep stirred the hated world an slept
Save only thee and me Oh Heaven oh God
How my heart beats in coupling those two words
Save only thee and me I paused I looked
And in an instant all things disappeared
Ah bear in mind this garden was enchanted
The pearly lustre of the moon went out
The mossy banks and the meandering paths
The happy flowers and the repining trees
Were seen no more the very roses odors
Died in the arms of the adoring airs
All all expired save thee save less than thou
Save only the divine light in thine eyes
Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes
I saw but them they were the world to me
I saw but them saw only them for hours
Saw only them until the moon went down
What wild hearthistories seemed to he enwritten
Upon those crystalline celestial spheres
How dark a woe yet how sublime a hope
How silently serene a sea of pride
How daring an ambition yet how deep
How fathomless a capacity for love
But now at length dear Dian sank from sight
Into a western couch of thundercloud
And thou a ghost amid the entombing trees
Didst glide away Only thine eyes remained
They would not go they never yet have gone
Lighting my lonely pathway home that night
They have not left me as my hopes have since
They follow me they lead me through the years
They are my ministers yet I their slave
Their office is to illumine and enkindle
My duty to be saved by their bright light
And purified in their electric fire
And sanctified in their elysian fire
They fill my soul with Beauty which is Hope
And are far up in Heaven the stars I kneel to
In the sad silent watches of my night
While even in the meridian glare of day
I see them still two sweetly scintillant
Venuses unextinguished by the sun
Helen thy beauty is to me
Like those Nicean barks of yore
That gently oer a perfumed sea
The weary wayworn wanderer bore
To his own native shore
On desperate seas long wont to roam
Thy hyacinth hair thy classic face
Thy Naiad airs have brought me home
To the glory that was Greece
And the grandeur that was Rome
Lo in yon brilliant windowniche
How statuelike I see thee stand
The agate lamp within thy hand
Ah Psyche from the regions which
Are Holy Land
I Beneath the vineclad eaves
Whose shadows fall before
Thy lowly cottage door
Under the lilacs tremulous leaves
Within thy snowy clasped hand
The purple flowers it bore
Last eve in dreams I saw thee stand
Like queenly nymph from Fairyland
Enchantress of the flowery wand
Most beauteous Isadore
II And when I bade the dream
Upon thy spirit flee
Thy violet eyes to me
Upturned did overflowing seem
With the deep untold delight
Of Loves serenity
Thy classic brow like lilies white
And pale as the Imperial Night
Upon her throne with stars bedight
Enthralled my soul to thee
III Ah ever I behold
Thy dreamy passionate eyes
Blue as the languid skies
Hung with the sunsets fringe of gold
Now strangely clear thine image grows
And olden memories
Are startled from their long repose
Like shadows on the silent snows
When suddenly the nightwind blows
Where quiet moonlight lies
IV Like music heard in dreams
Like strains of harps unknown
Of birds for ever flown
Audible as the voice of streams
That murmur in some leafy dell
I hear thy gentlest tone
And Silence cometh with her spell
Like that which on my tongue doth dwell
When tremulous in dreams I tell
My love to thee alone
V In every valley heard
Floating from tree to tree
Less beautiful to me
The music of the radiant bird
Than artless accents such as thine
Whose echoes never flee
Ah how for thy sweet voice I pine
For uttered in thy tones benign
Enchantress this rude name of mine
Doth seem a melody
Of all who hail thy presence as the morning
Of all to whom thine absence is the night
The blotting utterly from out high heaven
The sacred sun of all who weeping bless thee
Hourly for hope for life ah above all
For the resurrection of deepburied faith
In Truth in Virtue in Humanity
Of all who on Despairs unhallowed bed
Lying down to die have suddenly arisen
At thy softmurmured words Let there be light
At the softmurmured words that were fulfilled
In the seraphic glancing of thine eyes
Of all who owe thee most whose gratitude
Nearest resembles worship oh remember
The truest the most fervently devoted
And think that these weak lines are written by him
By him who as he pens them thrills to think
His spirit is communing with an angels
O I care not that my earthly lot
Hath little of Earth in it
That years of love have been forgot
In the fever of a minute
I heed not that the desolate
Are happier sweet than I
But that you meddle with my fate
Who am a passer by
It is not that my founts of bliss
Are gushing strange with tears
Or that the thrill of a single kiss
Hath palsied many years
Tis not that the flowers of twenty springs
Which have witherd as they rose
Lie dead on my heartstrings
With the weight of an age of snows
Not that the grass O may it thrive
On my grave is growing or grown
But that while I am dead yet alive
I cannot be lady alone
Of all who hail thy presence as the morning
Of all to whom thine absence is the night
The blotting utterly from out high heaven
The sacred sun of all who weeping bless thee
Hourly for hope for life ah above all
For the resurrection of deepburied faith
In Truth in Virtue in Humanity
Of all who on Despairs unhallowed bed
Lying down to die have suddenly arisen
At thy softmurmured words Let there be light
At the softmurmured words that were fulfilled
In the seraphic glancing of thine eyes
Of all who owe thee most whose gratitude
Nearest resembles worship oh remember
The truest the most fervently devoted
And think that these weak lines are written by him
By him who as he pens them thrills to think
His spirit is communing with an angels
Because I feel that in the Heavens above
The angels whispering to one another
Can find among their burning terms of love
None so devotional as that of Mother
Therefore by that dear name I long have called you
You who are more than mother unto me
And fill my heart of hearts where Death installed you
In setting my Virginias spirit free
My mother my own mother who died early
Was but the mother of myself but you
Are mother to the one I loved so dearly
And thus are dearer than the mother I knew
By that infinity with which my wife
Was dearer to my soul than its soullife
Seraph thy memory is to me
Like some enchanted faroff isle
In some tumultuous sea
Some ocean vexed as it may be
With storms but where meanwhile
Serenest skies continually
Just oer that one bright island smile
For mid the earnest cares and woes
That crowd around my earthly path
Sad path alas where grows
Not even one lonely rose
My soul at least a solace hath
In dreams of thee and therein knows
An Eden of bland repose
Thou wast all that to me love
For which my soul did pine
A green isle in the sea love
A fountain and a shrine
All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers
And all the flowers were mine
Ah dream too bright to last
Ah starry Hope that didst arise
But to be overcast
A voice from out the Future cries
On on but oer the Past
Dim gulf my spirit hovering lies
Mute motionless aghast
For alas alas me
For me the light of Life is over
No more no more no more
Such language holds the solemn sea
To the sands upon the shore
Shall bloom the thunderblasted tree
Or the stricken eagle soar
And all my days are trances
And all my nightly dreams
Are where thy grey eye glances
And where thy footstep gleams
In what ethereal dances
By what eternal streams
Fair river in thy bright clear flow
Of crystal wandering water
Thou art an emblem of the glow
Of beauty the unhidden heart
The playful maziness of art
In old Albertos daughter
But when within thy wave she looks
Which glistens then and trembles
Why then the prettiest of brooks
Her worshipper resembles
For in his heart as in thy stream
Her image deeply lies
His heart which trembles at the beam
Of her soulsearching eyes
The skies they were ashen and sober
The leaves they were crisped and sere
The leaves they were withering and sere
It was night in the lonesome October
Of my most immemorial year
It was hard by the dim lake of Auber
In the misty mid region of Weir
It was down by the dank tarn of Auber
In the ghoulhaunted woodland of Weir
Here once through an alley Titanic
Of cypress I roamed with my Soul
Of cypress with Psyche my Soul
There were days when my heart was volcanic
As the scoriac rivers that roll
As the lavas that restlessly roll
Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek
In the ultimate climes of the pole
That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek
In the realms of the boreal pole
Our talk had been serious and sober
But our thoughts they were palsied and sere
Our memories were treacherous and sere
For we knew not the month was October
And we marked not the night of the year
Ah night of all nights in the year
We noted not the dim lake of Auber
Though once we had journeyed down here
Remembered not the dank tarn of Auber
Nor the ghoulhaunted woodland of Weir
And now as the night was senescent
And stardials pointed to morn
As the stardials hinted of morn
At the end of our path a liquescent
And nebulous lustre was born
Out of which a miraculous crescent
Arose with a duplicate horn
Astartes bediamonded crescent
Distinct with its duplicate horn
And I said She is warmer than Dian
She rolls through an ether of sighs
She revels in a region of sighs
She has seen that the tears are not dry on
These cheeks where the worm never dies
And has come past the stars of the Lion
To point us the path to the skies
To the Lethean peace of the skies
Come up in despite of the Lion
To shine on us with her bright eyes
Come up through the lair of the Lion
With love in her luminous eyes
But Psyche uplifting her finger
Said Sadly this star I mistrust
Her pallor I strangely mistrust
Oh hasten oh let us not linger
Oh fly let us fly for we must
In terror she spoke letting sink her
Wings until they trailed in the dust
In agony sobbed letting sink her
Plumes till they trailed in the dust
Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust
I replied This is nothing but dreaming
Let us on by this tremulous light
Let us bathe in this crystalline light
Its Sybilic splendor is beaming
With Hope and in Beauty tonight
See it flickers up the sky through the night
Ah we safely may trust to its gleaming
And be sure it will lead us aright
We safely may trust to a gleaming
That cannot but guide us aright
Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night
Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her
And tempted her out of her gloom
And conquered her scruples and gloom
And we passed to the end of the vista
But were stopped by the door of a tomb
By the door of a legended tomb
And I said What is written sweet sister
On the door of this legended tomb
She replied Ulalume Ulalume
Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume
Then my heart it grew ashen and sober
As the leaves that were crisped and sere
As the leaves that were withering and sere
And I cried It was surely October
On this very night of last year
That I journeyed I journeyed down here
That I brought a dread burden down here
On this night of all nights in the year
Ah what demon has tempted me here
Well I know now this dim lake of Auber
This misty mid region of Weir
Well I know now this dank tarn of Auber
This ghoulhaunted woodland of Weir
The bowers whereat in dreams I see
The wantonest singing birds
Are lips and all thy melody
Of lipbegotten words
Thine eyes in Heaven of heart enshrined
Then desolately fall
O God on my funereal mind
Like starlight on a pall
Thy heart thy heart I wake and sigh
And sleep to dream till day
Of the truth that gold can never buy
Of the baubles that it may
The skies they were ashen and sober
The leaves they were crisped and sere
The leaves they were withering and sere
It was night in the lonesome October
Of my most immemorial year
It was hard by the dim lake of Auber
In the misty mid region of Weir
It was down by the dank tarn of Auber
In the ghoulhaunted woodland of Weir
Here once through an alley Titanic
Of cypress I roamed with my Soul
Of cypress with Psyche my Soul
These were days when my heart was volcanic
As the scoriac rivers that roll
As the lavas that restlessly roll
Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek
In the ultimate climes of the pole
That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek
In the realms of the boreal pole
Our talk had been serious and sober
But our thoughts they were palsied and sere
Our memories were treacherous and sere
For we knew not the month was October
And we marked not the night of the year
Ah night of all nights in the year
We noted not the dim lake of Auber
Though once we had journey down here
Remembered not the dank tarn of Auber
Nor the ghoulhaunted woodland of Weir
And now as the night was senescent
And stardials pointed to morn
As the stardials hinted of morn
At the end of our path a liquescent
And nebulous lustre was born
Out of which a miraculous crescent
Arose with a duplicate horn
Astartes bediamonded crescent
Distinct with its duplicate horn
And I said She is warmer than Dian
She rolls through an ether of sighs
She revels in a region of sighs
She has seen that the tears are not dry on
These cheeks where the worm never dies
And has come past the stars of the Lion
To point us the path to the skies
To the Lethean peace of the skies
Come up in despite of the Lion
To shine on us with her bright eyes
Come up through the lair of the Lion
With love in her luminous eyes
But Psyche uplifting her finger
Said Sadly this star I mistrust
Her pallor I strangely mistrust
Oh hasten oh let us not linger
Oh fly let us fly for we must
In terror she spoke letting sink her
Wings until they trailed in the dust
In agony sobbed letting sink her
Plumes till they trailed in the dust
Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust
I replied This is nothing but dreaming
Let us on by this tremulous light
Let us bathe in this crystalline light
Its Sybilic splendor is beaming
With Hope and in Beauty tonight
See it flickers up the sky through the night
Ah we safely may trust to its gleaming
And be sure it will lead us aright
We safely may trust to a gleaming
That cannot but guide us aright
Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night
Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her
And tempted her out of her gloom
And conquered her scruples and gloom
And we passed to the end of the vista
But were stopped by the door of a tomb
By the door of a legended tomb
And I said What is written sweet sister
On the door of this legended tomb
She replied Ulalume Ulalume
âTis the vault of thy lost Ulalume
Then my heart it grew ashen and sober
As the leaves that were crisped and sere
As the leaves that were withering and sere
And I cried It was surely October
On this very night of last year
That I journeyed I journeyed down here
That I brought a dread burden down here
On this night of all nights in the year
Ah what demon has tempted me here
Well I know now this dim lake of Auber
This misty mid region of Weir
Well I know now this dank tarn of Auber
This ghoulhaunted woodland of Weir
In visions of the dark night
I have dreamed of joy departed
But a waking dream of life and light
Hath left me brokenhearted
Ah what is not a dream by day
To him whose eyes are cast
On things around him with a ray
Turned back upon the past
That holy dream that holy dream
While all the world were chiding
Hath cheered me as a lovely beam
A lonely spirit guiding
What though that light thro storm and night
So trembled from afar
What could there be more purely bright
In Truths daystar
Take this kiss upon the brow
And in parting from you now
Thus much let me avow
You are not wrong who deem
That my days have been a dream
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night or in a day
In a vision or in none
Is it therefore the less gone
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream
I stand amid the roar
Of a surftormented shore
And I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand
How few yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep
While I weep while I weep
O God can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp
O God can I not save
One from the pitiless wave
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream
How shall the burial rite be read
The solemn song be sung
The requiem for the loveliest dead
That ever died so young
II
Her friends are gazing on her
And on her gaudy bier
And weep oh to dishonor
Dead beauty with a tear
III
They loved her for her wealth
And they hated her for her pride
But she grew in feeble health
And they love her that she died
IV
They tell me while they speak
Of her costly broiderd pall
That my voice is growing weak
That I should not sing at all
V
Or that my tone should be
Tund to such solemn song
So mournfully so mournfully
That the dead may feel no wrong
VI
But she is gone above
With young Hope at her side
And I am drunk with love
Of the dead who is my bride
VII
Of the dead dead who lies
All perfumd there
With the death upon her eyes
And the life upon her hair
VIII
Thus on the coffin loud and long
I strike the murmur sent
Through the grey chambers to my song
Shall be the accompaniment
IX
Thou diedst in thy lifes June
But thou didst not die too fair
Thou didst not die too soon
Nor with too calm an air
X
From more than fiends on earth
Thy life and love are riven
To join the untainted mirth
Of more than thrones in heaven
XII
Therefore to thee this night
I will no requiem raise
But waft thee on thy flight
With a PÃÂ¦an of old days
For her this rhyme is penned whose luminous eyes
Brightly expressive as the twins of Leda
Shall find her own sweet name that nestling lies
Upon the page enwrapped from every reader
Search narrowly the lines they hold a treasure
Divine a talisman an amulet
That must be worn at heart Search well the measure
The words the syllables Do not forget
The trivialest point or you may lose your labor
And yet there is in this no Gordian knot
Which one might not undo without a sabre
If one could merely comprehend the plot
Enwritten upon the leaf where now are peering
Eyes scintillating soul there lie perdus
Three eloquent words oft uttered in the hearing
Of poets by poets as the name is a poets too
Its letters although naturally lying
Like the knight Pinto Mendez Ferdinando
Still form a synonym for Truth Cease trying
You will not read the riddle though you do the best you can do
PART I
O nothing earthly save the ray
Thrown back from flowers of Beautys eye
As in those gardens where the day
Springs from the gems of Circassy
O nothing earthly save the thrill
Of melody in woodland rill
Or music of the passionhearted
Joys voice so peacefully departed
That like the murmur in the shell
Its echo dwelleth and will dwell
Oh nothing of the dross of ours
Yet all the beauty all the flowers
That list our Love and deck our bowers
Adorn yon world afar afar
The wandering star
Twas a sweet time for Nesace for there
Her world lay lolling on the golden air
Near four bright suns a temporary rest
An oasis in desert of the blest
Away away mid seas of rays that roll
Empyrean splendor oer th unchained soul
The soul that scarce the billows are so dense
Can struggle to its destind eminence
To distant spheres from time to time she rode
And late to ours the favord one of God
But now the ruler of an anchord realm
She throws aside the sceptre leaves the helm
And amid incense and high spiritual hymns
Laves in quadruple light her angel limbs
Now happiest loveliest in yon lovely Earth
Whence sprang the Idea of Beauty into birth
Falling in wreaths thro many a startled star
Like womans hair mid pearls until afar
It lit on hills Achaian and there dwelt
She looked into Infinity and knelt
Rich clouds for canopies about her curled
Fit emblems of the model of her world
Seen but in beauty not impeding sight
Of other beauty glittering thro the light
A wreath that twined each starry form around
And all the opald air in color bound
All hurriedly she knelt upon a bed
Of flowers of lilies such as reard the head
On the fair Capo Deucato and sprang
So eagerly around about to hang
Upon the flying footsteps of deep pride
Of her who lovd a mortal and so died
The Sephalica budding with young bees
Upreared its purple stem around her knees
And gemmy flower of Trebizond misnamd
Inmate of highest stars where erst it shamd
All other loveliness its honied dew
The fabled nectar that the heathen knew
Deliriously sweet was droppd from Heaven
And fell on gardens of the unforgiven
In Trebizond and on a sunny flower
So like its own above that to this hour
It still remaineth torturing the bee
With madness and unwonted reverie
In Heaven and all its environs the leaf
And blossom of the fairy plant in grief
Disconsolate linger grief that hangs her head
Repenting follies that full long have Red
Heaving her white breast to the balmy air
Like guilty beauty chastend and more fair
Nyctanthes too as sacred as the light
She fears to perfume perfuming the night
And Clytia pondering between many a sun
While pettish tears adown her petals run
And that aspiring flower that sprang on Earth
And died ere scarce exalted into birth
Bursting its odorous heart in spirit to wing
Its way to Heaven from garden of a king
And Valisnerian lotus thither flown
From struggling with the waters of the Rhone
And thy most lovely purple perfume Zante
Isola doro Fior di Levante
And the Nelumbo bud that floats for ever
With Indian Cupid down the holy river
Fair flowers and fairy to whose care is given
To bear the Goddess song in odors up to Heaven
Spirit that dwellest where
In the deep sky
The terrible and fair
In beauty vie
Beyond the line of blue
The boundary of the star
Which turneth at the view
Of thy barrier and thy bar
Of the barrier overgone
By the comets who were cast
From their pride and from their throne
To be drudges till the last
To be carriers of fire
The red fire of their heart
With speed that may not tire
And with pain that shall not part
Who livest that we know
In Eternity we feel
But the shadow of whose brow
What spirit shall reveal
Tho the beings whom thy Nesace
Thy messenger hath known
Have dreamd for thy Infinity
A model of their own
Thy will is done O God
The star hath ridden high
Thro many a tempest but she rode
Beneath thy burning eye
And here in thought to thee
In thought that can alone
Ascend thy empire and so be
A partner of thy throne
By winged Fantasy
My embassy is given
Till secrecy shall knowledge be
In the environs of Heaven
She ceasd and buried then her burning cheek
Abashd amid the lilies there to seek
A shelter from the fervor of His eye
For the stars trembled at the Deity
She stirrd not breathd not for a voice was there
How solemnly pervading the calm air
A sound of silence on the startled ear
Which dreamy poets name the music of the sphere
Ours is a world of words Quiet we call
Silence which is the merest word of all
All Nature speaks and evn ideal things
Flap shadowy sounds from visionary wings
But ah not so when thus in realms on high
The eternal voice of God is passing by
And the red winds are withering in the sky
What tho in worlds which sightless cycles run
Linked to a little system and one sun
Where all my love is folly and the crowd
Still think my terrors but the thunder cloud
The storm the earthquake and the oceanwrath
Ah will they cross me in my angrier path
What tho in worlds which own a single sun
The sands of Time grow dimmer as they run
Yet thine is my resplendency so given
To bear my secrets thro the upper Heaven
Leave tenantless thy crystal home and fly
With all thy train athwart the moony sky
Apart like fireflies in Sicilian night
And wing to other worlds another light
Divulge the secrets of thy embassy
To the proud orbs that twinkle and so be
To evry heart a barrier and a ban
Lest the stars totter in the guilt of man
Up rose the maiden in the yellow night
The singlemooned eve on Earth we plight
Our faith to one love and one moon adore
The birthplace of young Beauty had no more
As sprang that yellow star from downy hours
Up rose the maiden from her shrine of flowers
And bent oer sheeny mountains and dim plain
Her way but left not yet her Therasaean reign

PART II
High on a mountain of enamelld head
Such as the drowsy shepherd on his bed
Of giant pasturage lying at his ease
Raising his heavy eyelid starts and sees
With many a mutterd hope to be forgiven
What time the moon is quadrated in Heaven
Of rosy head that towering far away
Into the sunlit ether caught the ray
Of sunken suns at eve at noon of night
While the moon dancd with the fair stranger light
Upreard upon such height arose a pile
Of gorgeous columns on th unburthend air
Flashing from Parian marble that twin smile
Far down upon the wave that sparkled there
And nursled the young mountain in its lair
Of molten stars their pavement such as fall
Thro the ebon air besilvering the pall
Of their own dissolution while they die
Adorning then the dwellings of the sky
A dome by linked light from Heaven let down
Sat gently on these columns as a crown
A window of one circular diamond there
Lookd out above into the purple air
And rays from God shot down that meteor chain
And hallowd all the beauty twice again
Save when between th empyrean and that ring
Some eager spirit Flappd his dusky wing
But on the pillars Seraph eyes have seen
The dimness of this world that greyish green
That Nature loves the best Beautys grave
Lurkd in each cornice round each architrave
And every sculpturd cherub thereabout
That from his marble dwelling peered out
Seemd earthly in the shadow of his niche
Achaian statues in a world so rich
Friezes from Tadmor and Persepolis
From Balbec and the stilly clear abyss
Of beautiful Gomorrah O the wave
Is now upon thee but too late to save
Sound loves to revel in a summer night
Witness the murmur of the grey twilight
That stole upon the ear in Eyraco
Of many a wild stargazer long ago
That stealeth ever on the ear of him
Who musing gazeth on the distance dim
And sees the darkness coming as a cloud
Is not its form its voice most palpable and loud
But what is this it cometh and it brings
A music with it tis the rush of wings
A pause and then a sweeping falling strain
And Nesace is in her halls again
From the wild energy of wanton haste
Her cheeks were flushing and her lips apart
And zone that clung around her gentle waist
Had burst beneath the heaving of her heart
Within the centre of that hall to breathe
She paused and panted Zanthe all beneath
The fairy light that kissd her golden hair
And longd to rest yet could but sparkle there
Young flowers were whispering in melody
To happy flowers that night and tree to tree
Fountains were gushing music as they fell
In many a starlit grove or moonlit dell
Yet silence came upon material things
Fair flowers bright waterfalls and angel wings
And sound alone that from the spirit sprang
Bore burthen to the charm the maiden sang
Neath the bluebell or streamer
Or tufted wild spray
That keeps from the dreamer
The moonbeam away
Bright beings that ponder
With half closing eyes
On the stars which your wonder
Hath drawn from the skies
Till they glance thro the shade and
Come down to your brow
Like eyes of the maiden
Who calls on you now
Arise from your dreaming
In violet bowers
To duty beseeming
These starlitten hours
And shake from your tresses
Encumberd with dew
The breath of those kisses
That cumber them too
O how without you Love
Could angels be blest
Those kisses of true Love
That lulld ye to rest
Up shake from your wing
Each hindering thing
The dew of the night
It would weigh down your flight
And true love caresses
O leave them apart
They are light on the tresses
But lead on the heart
Ligeia Ligeia
My beautiful one
Whose harshest idea
Will to melody run
O is it thy will
On the breezes to toss
Or capriciously still
Like the lone Albatros
Incumbent on night
As she on the air
To keep watch with delight
On the harmony there
Ligeia wherever
Thy image may be
No magic shall sever
Thy music from thee
Thou hast bound many eyes
In a dreamy sleep
But the strains still arise
Which thy vigilance keep
The sound of the rain
Which leaps down to the flower
And dances again
In the rhythm of the shower
The murmur that springs
From the growing of grass
Are the music of things
But are modelld alas
Away then my dearest
Oh hie thee away
To the springs that lie clearest
Beneath the moonray
To lone lake that smiles
In its dream of deep rest
At the many starisles
That enjewel its breast
Where wild flowers creeping
Have mingled their shade
On its margin is sleeping
Full many a maid
Some have left the cool glade and
Have slept with the bee
Arouse them my maiden
On moorland and lea
Go breathe on their slumber
All softly in ear
Thy musical number
They slumbered to hear
For what can awaken
An angel so soon
Whose sleep hath been taken
Beneath the cold moon
As the spell which no slumber
Of witchery may test
The rhythmical number
Which lulld him to rest
Spirits in wing and angels to the view
A thousand seraphs burst th Empyrean thro
Young dreams still hovering on their drowsy flight
Seraphs in all but Knowledge the keen light
That fell refracted thro thy bounds afar
O Death from eye of God upon that star
Sweet was that error sweeter still that death
Sweet was that error even with us the breath
Of Science dims the mirror of our joy
To them twere the Simoom and would destroy
For what to them availeth it to know
That Truth is Falsehood or that Bliss is Woe
Sweet was their death with them to die was rife
With the last ecstasy of satiate life
Beyond that death no immortality
But sleep that pondereth and is not to be
And there oh may my weary spirit dwell
Apart from Heavens Eternity and yet how far from Hell
What guilty spirit in what shrubbery dim
Heard not the stirring summons of that hymn
But two they fell for Heaven no grace imparts
To those who hear not for their beating hearts
A maidenangel and her seraphlover
O where and ye may seek the wide skies over
Was Love the blind near sober Duty known
Unguided Love hath fallen mid tears of perfect moan
He was a goodly spirit he who fell
A wanderer by mossymantled well
A gazer on the lights that shine above
A dreamer in the moonbeam by his love
What wonder for each star is eyelike there
And looks so sweetly down on Beautys hair
And they and evry mossy spring were holy
To his lovehaunted heart and melancholy
The night had found to him a night of woe
Upon a mountain crag young Angelo
Beetling it bends athwart the solemn sky
And scowls on starry worlds that down beneath it lie
Here sat he with his love his dark eye bent
With eagle gaze along the firmament
Now turnd it upon her but ever then
It trembled to the orb of EARTH again
Ianthe dearest see how dim that ray
How lovely tis to look so far away
She seemd not thus upon that autumn eve
I left her gorgeous halls nor mournd to leave
That eve that eve I should remember well
The sunray droppd in Lemnos with a spell
On th arabesque carving of a gilded hall
Wherein I sate and on the draperied wall
And on my eyelids O the heavy light
How drowsily it weighd them into night
On flowers before and mist and love they ran
With Persian Saadi in his Gulistan
But O that light I slumberd Death the while
Stole oer my senses in that lovely isle
So softly that no single silken hair
Awoke that slept or knew that he was there
The last spot of Earths orb I trod upon
Was a proud temple calld the Parthenon
More beauty clung around her columnd wall
Than evn thy glowing bosom beats withal
And when old Time my wing did disenthral
Thence sprang I as the eagle from his tower
And years I left behind me in an hour
What time upon her airy bounds I hung
One half the garden of her globe was flung
Unrolling as a chart unto my view
Tenantless cities of the desert too
Ianthe beauty crowded on me then
And half I wishd to be again of men
My Angelo and why of them to be
A brighter dwellingplace is here for thee
And greener fields than in yon world above
And womans loveliness and passionate love
But list Ianthe when the air so soft
Faild as my pennond spirit leapt aloft
Perhaps my brain grew dizzy but the world
I left so late was into chaos hurld
Sprang from her station on the winds apart
And rolld a flame the fiery Heaven athwart
Methought my sweet one then I ceased to soar
And fell not swiftly as I rose before
But with a downward tremulous motion thro
Light brazen rays this golden star unto
Nor long the measure of my falling hours
For nearest of all stars was thine to ours
Dread star that came amid a night of mirth
A red Daedalion on the timid Earth
We came and to thy Earth but not to us
Be given our ladys bidding to discuss
We came my love around above below
Gay firefly of the night we come and go
Nor ask a reason save the angelnod
She grants to us as granted by her God
But Angelo than thine grey Time unfurld
Never his fairy wing Oer fairier world
Dim was its little disk and angel eyes
Alone could see the phantom in the skies
When first Al Aaraaf knew her course to be
Headlong thitherward oer the starry sea
But when its glory swelld upon the sky
As glowing Beautys bust beneath mans eye
We paused before the heritage of men
And thy star trembled as doth Beauty then
Thus in discourse the lovers whiled away
The night that waned and waned and brought no day
They fell for Heaven to them no hope imparts
Who hear not for the beating of their hearts
From childhoods hour I have not been
As others were I have not seen
As others saw I could not bring
My passions from a common spring
From the same source I have not taken
My sorrow I could not awaken
My heart to joy at the same tone
And all I loved I loved alone
Then in my childhood in the dawn
Of a most stormy life was drawn
From every depth of good and ill
The mystery which binds me still
From the torrent or the fountain
From the red cliff of the mountain
From the sun that round me rolled
In its autumn tint of gold
From the lightning in the sky
As it passed me flying by
From the thunder and the storm
And the cloud that took the form
When the rest of Heaven was blue
Of a demon in my view
Elizabeth it is in vain you say
Love not thou sayest it in so sweet a way
In vain those words from thee or L E L
Zantippes talents had enforced so well
Ah if that language from thy heart arise
Breathe it less gently forth and veil thine eyes
Endymion recollect when Luna tried
To cure his love was cured of all beside
His folly pride and passion for he died
Seldom we find says Solomon Don Dunce
Half an idea in the profoundest sonnet
Through all the flimsy things we see at once
As easily as through a Naples bonnet
Trash of all trash how can a lady don it
Yet heavier far than your Petrarchan stuff
Owldowny nonsense that the faintest puff
Twirls into trunkpaper the while you con it
And veritably Sol is right enough
The general tuckermanities are arrant
Bubbles ephemeral and so transparent
But this is now you may depend upon it
Stable opaque immortal all by dint
Of the dear names that he concealed within t
It was many and many a year ago
In a kingdom by the sea
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
By the name of ANNABEL LEE
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love and be loved by me
I was a child and she was a child
In this kingdom by the sea
But we loved with a love that was more than love
I and my Annabel Lee
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
Coveted her and me
And this was the reason that long ago
In this kingdom by the sea
A wind blew out of a cloud chilling
My beautiful Annabel Lee
So that her highborn kinsman came
And bore her away from me
To shut her up in a sepulchre
In this kingdom by the sea
The angels not half so happy in heaven
Went envying her and me
Yes that was the reason as all men know
In this kingdom by the sea
That the wind came out of the cloud by night
Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee
But our love it was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we
Of many far wiser than we
And neither the angels in heaven above
Nor the demons down under the sea
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee
For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee
And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee
And so all the nighttide I lie down by the side
Of my darling my darling my life and my bride
In the sepulchre there by the sea
In her tomb by the sounding sea
The ring is on my hand
And the wreath is on my brow
Satin and jewels grand
Are all at my command
And I am happy now
And my lord he loves me well
But when first he breathed his vow
I felt my bosom swell
For the words rang as a knell
And the voice seemed his who fell
In the battle down the dell
And who is happy now
But he spoke to reassure me
And he kissed my pallid brow
While a reverie came oer me
And to the churchyard bore me
And I sighed to him before me
Thinking him dead DElormie
Oh I am happy now
And thus the words were spoken
And this the plighted vow
And though my faith be broken
And though my heart be broken
Here is a ring as token
That I am happy now
Would God I could awaken
For I dream I know not how
And my soul is sorely shaken
Lest an evil step be taken
Lest the dead who is forsaken
May not be happy now
By a route obscure and lonely
Haunted by ill angels only
Where an Eidolon named NIGHT
On a black throne reigns upright
I have reached these lands but newly
From an ultimate dim Thule
From a wild clime that lieth sublime
Out of SPACE out of TIME
Bottomless vales and boundless floods
And chasms and caves and Titan woods
With forms that no man can discover
For the tears that drip all over
Mountains toppling evermore
Into seas without a shore
Seas that restlessly aspire
Surging unto skies of fire
Lakes that endlessly outspread
Their lone waters lone and dead
Their still waters still and chilly
With the snows of the lolling lily
By the lakes that thus outspread
Their lone waters lone and dead
Their sad waters sad and chilly
With the snows of the lolling lily
By the mountains near the river
Murmuring lowly murmuring ever
By the grey woods by the swamp
Where the toad and the newt encamp
By the dismal tarns and pools
Where dwell the Ghouls
By each spot the most unholy
In each nook most melancholy
There the traveller meets aghast
Sheeted Memories of the Past
Shrouded forms that start and sigh
As they pass the wanderer by
Whiterobed forms of friends long given
In agony to the Earth and Heaven
For the heart whose woes are legion
Tis a peaceful soothing region
For the spirit that walks in shadow
Tis oh tis an Eldorado
But the traveller travelling through it
May not dare not openly view it
Never its mysteries are exposed
To the weak human eye unclosed
So wills its King who hath forbid
The uplifting of the fringed lid
And thus the sad Soul that here passes
Beholds it but through darkened glasses
By a route obscure and lonely
Haunted by ill angels only
Where an Eidolon named NIGHT
On a black throne reigns upright
I have wandered home but newly
From this ultimate dim Thule
Oh that my young life were a lasting dream
My spirit not awakening till the beam
Of an Eternity should bring the morrow
Yes tho that long dream were of hopeless sorrow
Twere better than the cold reality
Of waking life to him whose heart must be
And hath been still upon the lovely earth
A chaos of deep passion from his birth
But should it be that dream eternally
Continuing as dreams have been to me
In my young boyhood should it thus be given
Twere folly still to hope for higher Heaven
For I have revelld when the sun was bright
I the summer sky in dreams of living light
And loveliness have left my very heart
In climes of my imagining apart
From mine own home with beings that have been
Of mine own thought what more could I have seen
Twas once and only once and the wild hour
From my remembrance shall not pass some power
Or spell had bound me twas the chilly wind
Came oer me in the night and left behind
Its image on my spirit or the moon
Shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon
Too coldly or the stars howeer it was
That dream was as that nightwind let it pass
I have been happy tho in a dream
I have been happy and I love the theme
Dreams in their vivid coloring of life
As in that fleeting shadowy misty strife
Of semblance with reality which brings
To the delirious eye more lovely things
Of Paradise and Love and all our own
Than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known
Gaily bedight
A gallant knight
In sunshine and in shadow
Had journeyed long
Singing a song
In search of Eldorado
But he grew old
This knight so bold
And oer his heart a shadow
Fell as he found
No spot of ground
That looked like Eldorado
And as his strength
Failed him at length
He met a pilgrim shadow
Shadow said he
Where can it be
This land of Eldorado
Over the Mountains
Of the Moon
Down the Valley of the Shadow
Ride boldly ride
The shade replied
If you seek for Eldorado
Elizabeth it surely is most fit
Logic and common usage so commanding
In thy own book that first thy name be writ
Zeno and other sages notwithstanding
And I have other reasons for so doing
Besides my innate love of contradiction
Each poet if a poet in pursuing
The muses thro their bowers of Truth or Fiction
Has studied very little of his part
Read nothing written less in shorts a fool
Endued with neither soul nor sense nor art
Being ignorant of one important rule
Employed in even the theses of the school
Called I forget the heathenish Greek name
Called anything its meaning is the same
Always write first things uppermost in the heart
The noblest name in Allegorys page
The hand that traced inexorable rage
A pleasing moralist whose page refined
Displays the deepest knowledge of the mind
A tender poet of a foreign tongue
Indited in the language that he sung
A bard of brilliant but unlicensed page
At once the shame and glory of our age
The prince of harmony and stirling sense
The ancient dramatist of eminence
The bard that paints imaginations powers
And him whose song revives departed hours
Once more an ancient tragic bard recall
In boldness of design surpassing all
These names when rightly read a name make known
Which gathers all their glories in its own
Ill tell you a plan for gaining wealth
Better than banking trade or leases
Take a bank note and fold it up
And then you will find your money in creases
This wonderful plan without danger or loss
Keeps your cash in your hands where nothing can trouble it
And every time that you fold it across
Tis as plain as the light of the day that you double it
I dwelt alone
In a world of moan
And my soul was a stagnant tide
Till the fair and gentle Eulalie became my blushing bride
Till the yellowhaired young Eulalie became my smiling bride
Ah less less bright
The stars of the night
Than the eyes of the radiant girl
That the vapor can make
With the moontints of purple and pearl
Can vie with the modest Eulalies most unregarded curl
Can compare with the brighteyed Eulalies most humble and careless
curl
Now Doubt now Pain
Come never again
For her soul gives me sigh for sigh
And all day long
Shines bright and strong
Astarte within the sky
While ever to her dear Eulalie upturns her matron eye
While ever to her young Eulalie upturns her violet eye
Twas noontide of summer
And midtime of night
And stars in their orbits
Shone pale thro the light
Of the brighter cold moon
Mid planets her slaves
Herself in the Heavens
Her beam on the waves
I gazed awhile
On her cold smile
Too cold too cold for me
There passd as a shroud
A fleecy cloud
And I turned away to thee
Proud Evening Star
In thy glory afar
And dearer thy beam shall be
For joy to my heart
Is the proud part
Thou bearest in Heaven at night
And more I admire
Thy distant fire
Than that colder lowly light
Dim vales and shadowy floods
And cloudylooking woods
Whose forms we cant discover
For the tears that drip all over
Huge moons there wax and wane
Again again again
Every moment of the night
Forever changing places
And they put out the starlight
With the breath from their pale faces
About twelve by the moondial
One more filmy than the rest
A kind which upon trial
They have found to be the best
Comes down still down and down
With its centre on the crown
Of a mountains eminence
While its wide circumference
In easy drapery falls
Over hamlets over halls
Wherever they may be
Oer the strange woods oer the sea
Over spirits on the wing
Over every drowsy thing
And buries them up quite
In a labyrinth of light
And then how deep O deep
Is the passion of their sleep
In the morning they arise
And their moony covering
Is soaring in the skies
With the tempests as they toss
Like almost anything
Or a yellow Albatross
They use that moon no more
For the same end as before
Videlicet a tent
Which I think extravagant
Its atomies however
Into a shower dissever
Of which those butterflies
Of Earth who seek the skies
And so come down again
Nevercontented things
Have brought a specimen
Upon their quivering wings
Thank Heaven the crisis
The danger is past
And the lingering illness
Is over at last
And the fever called Living
Is conquered at last
Sadly I know
I am shorn of my strength
And no muscle I move
As I lie at full length
But no matterI feel
I am better at length
And I rest so composedly
Now in my bed
That any beholder
Might fancy me dead
Might start at beholding me
Thinking me dead
The moaning and groaning
The sighing and sobbing
Are quieted now
With that horrible throbbing
At heart ah that horrible
Horrible throbbing
The sickness the nausea
The pitiless pain
Have ceased with the fever
That maddened my brain
With the fever called Living
That burned in my brain
And oh of all tortures
That torture the worst
Has abated the terrible
Torture of thirst
For the naphthaline river
Of Passion accurst
I have drunk of a water
That quenches all thirst
Of a water that flows
With a lullaby sound
From a spring but a very few
Feet under ground
From a cavern not very far
Down under ground
And ah let it never
Be foolishly said
That my room it is gloomy
And narrow my bed
For man never slept
In a different bed
And to sleep you must slumber
In just such a bed
My tantalized spirit
Here blandly reposes
Forgetting or never
Regretting its roses
Its old agitations
Of myrtles and roses
For now while so quietly
Lying it fancies
A holier odor
About it of pansies
A rosemary odor
Commingled with pansies
With rue and the beautiful
Puritan pansies
And so it lies happily
Bathing in many
A dream of the truth
And the beauty of Annie
Drowned in a bath
Of the tresses of Annie
She tenderly kissed me
She fondly caressed
And then I fell gently
To sleep on her breast
Deeply to sleep
From the heaven of her breast
When the light was extinguished
She covered me warm
And she prayed to the angels
To keep me from harm
To the queen of the angels
To shield me from harm
And I lie so composedly
Now in my bed
Knowing her love
That you fancy me dead
And I rest so contentedly
Now in my bed
With her love at my breast
That you fancy me dead
That you shudder to look at me
Thinking me dead
But my heart it is brighter
Than all of the many
Stars in the sky
For it sparkles with Annie
It glows with the light
Of the love of my Annie
With the thought of the light
Of the eyes of my Annie
Wreathed in myrtle my sword Ill conceal
Like those champions devoted and brave
When they plunged in the tyrant their steel
And to Athens deliverance gave
Beloved heroes your deathless souls roam
In the joy breathing isles of the blest
Where the mighty of old have their home
Where Achilles and Diomed rest
In fresh myrtle my blade Ill entwine
Like Harmodious the gallant and good
When he made at the tutelar shrine
A libation of Tyrannys blood
Ye deliverers of Athens from shame
Ye avengers of Libertys wrongs
Endless ages shall cherish your fame
Embalmed in their echoing songs
At morn at noon at twilight dim
Maria thou hast heard my hymn
In joy and woe in good and ill
Mother of God be with me still
When the hours flew brightly by
And not a cloud obscured the sky
My soul lest it should truant be
Thy grace did guide to thine and thee
Now when storms of Fate oercast
Darkly my Present and my Past
Let my Future radiant shine
With sweet hopes of thee and thine
A dark unfathomed tide
Of interminable pride
A mystery and a dream
Should my early life seem
I say that dream was fraught
With a wild and waking thought
Of beings that have been
Which my spirit hath not seen
Had I let them pass me by
With a dreaming eye
Let none of earth inherit
That vision of my spirit
Those thoughts I would control
As a spell upon his soul
For that bright hope at last
And that light time have past
And my worldly rest hath gone
With a sigh as it passed on
I care not though it perish
With a thought I then did cherish
When from your gems of thought I turn
To those pure orbs your heart to learn
I scarce know which to prize most high
The bright idea or the bright deareye
I
In the greenest of our valleys
By good angels tenanted
Once fair and stately palace
Radiant palace reared its head
In the monarch Thoughts dominion
It stood there
Never seraph spread a pinion
Over fabric half so fair
II
Banners yellow glorious golden
On its roof did float and flow
This all this was in the olden
Time long ago
And every gentle air that dallied
In that sweet day
Along the ramparts plumed and pallid
A winged odour went away
III
Wanderers in that happy valley
Through two luminous windows saw
Spirits moving musically
To a lutes welltuned law
Round about a throne where sitting
Porphyrogene
In state his glory well befitting
The ruler of the realm was seen
IV
And all with pearl and ruby glowing
Was the fair palace door
Through which came flowing flowing flowing
And sparkling evermore
A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty
Was but to sing
In voices of surpassing beauty
The wit and wisdom of their king
V
But evil things in robes of sorrow
Assailed the monarchs high estate
Ah let us mourn for never morrow
Shall dawn upon him desolate
And round about his home the glory
That blushed and bloomed
Is but a dimremembered story
Of the old time entombed
VI
And travellers now within that valley
Through the redlitten windows see
Vast forms that move fantastically
To a discordant melody
While like a rapid ghastly river
Through the pale door
A hideous throng rush out forever
And laugh but smile no more
How often we forget all time when lone
Admiring Natures universal throne
Her woods her winds her mountains the intense
Reply of Hers to Our intelligence
I
In youth I have known one with whom the Earth
In secret communing held as he with it
In daylight and in beauty from his birth
Whose fervid flickering torch of life was lit
From the sun and stars whence he had drawn forth
A passionate light such for his spirit was fit
And yet that spirit knew not in the hour
Of its own fervour what had oer it power
II
Perhaps it may be that my mind is wrought
To a fever by the moonbeam that hangs oer
But I will half believe that wild light fraught
With more of sovereignty than ancient lore
Hath ever told or is it of a thought
The unembodied essence and no more
That with a quickening spell doth oer us pass
As dew of the night time oer the summer grass
III
Doth oer us pass when as th expanding eye
To the loved object so the tear to the lid
Will start which lately slept in apathy
And yet it need not be that object hid
From us in life but common which doth lie
Each hour before us but then only bid
With a strange sound as of a harpstring broken
T awake us Tis a symbol and a token
IV
Of what in other worlds shall be and given
In beauty by our God to those alone
Who otherwise would fall from life and Heaven
Drawn by their hearts passion and that tone
That high tone of the spirit which hath striven
Though not with Faith with godliness whose throne
With desperate energy t hath beaten down
Wearing its own deep feeling as a crown
In Heaven a spirit doth dwell
Whose heartstrings are a lute
None sing so wildly well
As the angel Israfel
And the giddy stars so legends tell
Ceasing their hymns attend the spell
Of his voice all mute
Tottering above
In her highest noon
The enamored moon
Blushes with love
While to listen the red levin
With the rapid Pleiads even
Which were seven
Pauses in Heaven
And they say the starry choir
And the other listening things
That Israfelis fire
Is owing to that lyre
By which he sits and sings
The trembling living wire
Of those unusual strings
But the skies that angel trod
Where deep thoughts are a duty
Where Loves a grownup God
Where the Houri glances are
Imbued with all the beauty
Which we worship in a star
Therefore thou art not wrong
Israfeli who despisest
An unimpassioned song
To thee the laurels belong
Best bard because the wisest
Merrily live and long
The ecstasies above
With thy burning measures suit
Thy grief thy joy thy hate thy love
With the fervor of thy lute
Well may the stars be mute
Yes Heaven is thine but this
Is a world of sweets and sours
Our flowers are merely flowers
And the shadow of thy perfect bliss
Is the sunshine of ours
If I could dwell
Where Israfel
Hath dwelt and he where I
He might not sing so wildly well
A mortal melody
While a bolder note than this might swell
From my lyre within the sky
Ah broken is the golden bowl the spirit flown forever
Let the bell toll a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river
And Guy de Vere hast thou no tear weep now or nevermore
See on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love Lenore
Come let the burial rite be read the funeral song be sung
An anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young
A dirge for her the doubly dead in that she died so young
Wretches ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride
And when she fell in feeble health ye blessed her that she died
How shall the ritual then be read the requiem how be sung
By you by yours the evil eye by yours the slanderous tongue
That did to death the innocence that died and died so young
Peccavimus but rave not thus and let a Sabbath song
Go up to God so solemnly the dead may feel no wrong
The sweet Lenore hath gone before with Hope that flew beside
Leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy
bride
For her the fair and debonair that now so lowly lies
The life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes
The life still there upon her hair the death upon her eyes
Avaunt avaunt from fiends below the indignant ghost is riven
From Hell unto a high estate far up within the Heaven
From grief and groan to a golden throne beside the King of
Heaven
Let no bell toll then lest her soul amid its hallowed mirth
Should catch the note as it doth float up from the damned Earth
And I tonight my heart is light no dirge will I upraise
But waft the angel on her flight with a Paean of old days
Romance who loves to nod and sing
With drowsy head and folded wing
Among the green leaves as they shake
Far down within some shadowy lake
To me a painted paroquet
Hath been a most familiar bird
Taught me my alphabet to say
To lisp my very earliest word
While in the wild wood I did lie
A child with a most knowing eye
Of late eternal Condor years
So shake the very Heaven on high
With tumult as they thunder by
I have no time for idle cares
Through gazing on the unquiet sky
And when an hour with calmer wings
Its down upon my spirit flings
That little time with lyre and rhyme
To while away forbidden things
My heart would feel to be a crime
Unless it trembled with the strings
Sancta Maria turn thine eyes
Upon the sinners sacrifice
Of fervent prayer and humble love
From thy holy throne above
At morn at noon at twilight dim
Maria thou hast heard my hymn
In joy and wo in good and ill
Mother of God be with me still
When the Hours flew brightly by
And not a cloud obscured the sky
My soul lest it should truant be
Thy grace did guide to thine and thee
Now when storms of Fate oercast
Darkly my Present and my Past
Let my Future radiant shine
With sweet hopes of thee and thine
So sweet the hour so calm the time
I feel it more than half a crime
When Nature sleeps and stars are mute
To mar the silence evn with lute
At rest on oceans brilliant dyes
An image of Elysium lies
Seven Pleiades entranced in Heaven
Form in the deep another seven
Endymion nodding from above
Sees in the sea a second love
Within the valleys dim and brown
And on the spectral mountains crown
The wearied light is dying down
And earth and stars and sea and sky
Are redolent of sleep as I
Am redolent of thee and thine
Enthralling love my Adeline
But list O list so soft and low
Thy lovers voice tonight shall flow
That scarce awake thy soul shall deem
My words the music of a dream
Thus while no single sound too rude
Upon thy slumber shall intrude
Our thoughts our souls O God above
In every deed shall mingle love
I saw thee on thy bridal day
When a burning blush came oer thee
Though happiness around thee lay
The world all love before thee
And in thine eye a kindling light
Whatever it might be
Was all on Earth my aching sight
Of Loveliness could see
That blush perhaps was maiden shame
As such it well may pass
Though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame
In the breast of him alas
Who saw thee on that bridal day
When that deep blush would come oer thee
Though happiness around thee lay
The world all love before thee
There are some qualities some incorporate things
That have a double life which thus is made
A type of that twin entity which springs
From matter and light evinced in solid and shade
There is a twofold Silence sea and shore
Body and soul One dwells in lonely places
Newly with grass oergrown some solemn graces
Some human memories and tearful lore
Render him terrorless his names No More
He is the corporate Silence dread him not
No power hath he of evil in himself
But should some urgent fate untimely lot
Bring thee to meet his shadow nameless elf
That haunteth the lone regions where hath trod
No foot of man commend thyself to God
Science true daughter of Old Time thou art
Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes
Why preyest thou thus upon the poets heart
Vulture whose wings are dull realities
How should he love thee or how deem thee wise
Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering
To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies
Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing
Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car
And driven the Hamadryad from the wood
To seek a shelter in some happier star
Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood
The Elfin from the green grass and from me
The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree
Fair isle that from the fairest of all flowers
Thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take
How many memories of what radiant hours
At sight of thee and thine at once awake
How many scenes of what departed bliss
How many thoughts of what entombed hopes
How many visions of a maiden that is
No more no more upon thy verdant slopes
No more alas that magical sad sound
Transforming all Thy charms shall please no more
Thy memory no more Accursed ground
Henceforth I hold thy flowerenameled shore
O hyacinthine isle O purple Zante
Isola doro Fior di Levante
Thy soul shall find itself alone
Mid dark thoughts of the grey tombstone
Not one of all the crowd to pry
Into thine hour of secrecy
Be silent in that solitude
Which is not loneliness for then
The spirits of the dead who stood
In life before thee are again
In death around thee and their will
Shall overshadow thee be still
The night though clear shall frown
And the stars shall not look down
From their high thrones in the Heaven
With light like hope to mortals given
But their red orbs without beam
To thy weariness shall seem
As a burning and a fever
Which would cling to thee for ever
Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish
Now are visions neer to vanish
From thy spirit shall they pass
No more like dewdrop from the grass
The breeze the breath of God is still
And the mist upon the hill
Shadowy shadowy yet unbroken
Is a symbol and a token
How it hangs upon the trees
A mystery of mysteries
How often we forget all time when lone
Admiring Natures universal throne
Her woods her wilds her mountains the intense

Kind solace in a dying hour
Such father is not now my theme
I will not madly deem that power
Of Earth may shrive me of the sin
Unearthly pride hath revelld in
I have no time to dote or dream
You call it hope that fire of fire
It is but agony of desire
If I can hope Oh God I can
Its fount is holier more divine
I would not call thee fool old man
But such is not a gift of thine
Know thou the secret of a spirit
Bowd from its wild pride into shame
O yearning heart I did inherit
Thy withering portion with the fame
The searing glory which hath shone
Amid the jewels of my throne
Halo of Hell and with a pain
Not Hell shall make me fear again
O craving heart for the lost flowers
And sunshine of my summer hours
The undying voice of that dead time
With its interminable chime
Rings in the spirit of a spell
Upon thy emptiness a knell
I have not always been as now
The feverd diadem on my brow
I claimd and won usurpingly
Hath not the same fierce heirdom given
Rome to the Caesar this to me
The heritage of a kingly mind
And a proud spirit which hath striven
Triumphantly with human kind
On mountain soil I first drew life
The mists of the Taglay have shed
Nightly their dews upon my head
And I believe the winged strife
And tumult of the headlong air
Have nestled in my very hair
So late from Heaven that dew it fell
Mid dreams of an unholy night
Upon me with the touch of Hell
While the red flashing of the light
From clouds that hung like banners oer
Appeared to my halfclosing eye
The pageantry of monarchy
And the deep trumpetthunders roar
Came hurriedly upon me telling
Of human battle where my voice
My own voice silly child was swelling
O how my spirit would rejoice
And leap within me at the cry
The battlecry of Victory
The rain came down upon my head
Unshelterd and the heavy wind
Rendered me mad and deaf and blind
It was but man I thought who shed
Laurels upon me and the rush
The torrent of the chilly air
Gurgled within my ear the crush
Of empires with the captives prayer
The hum of suitors and the tone
Of flattery round a sovereigns throne
My passions from that hapless hour
Usurpd a tyranny which men
Have deemd since I have reachd to power
My innate nature be it so
But father there livd one who then
Then in my boyhood when their fire
Burnd with a still intenser glow
For passion must with youth expire
Een then who knew this iron heart
In womans weakness had a part
I have no words alas to tell
The loveliness of loving well
Nor would I now attempt to trace
The more than beauty of a face
Whose lineaments upon my mind
Are shadows on th unstable wind
Thus I remember having dwelt
Some page of early lore upon
With loitering eye till I have felt
The letters with their meaning melt
To fantasies with none
O she was worthy of all love
Love as in infancy was mine
Twas such as angel minds above
Might envy her young heart the shrine
On which my every hope and thought
Were incense then a goodly gift
For they were childish and upright
Pure as her young example taught
Why did I leave it and adrift
Trust to the fire within for light
We grew in age and love together
Roaming the forest and the wild
My breast her shield in wintry weather
And when the friendly sunshine smild
And she would mark the opening skies
I saw no Heaven but in her eyes
Young Loves first lesson is the heart
For mid that sunshine and those smiles
When from our little cares apart
And laughing at her girlish wiles
Id throw me on her throbbing breast
And pour my spirit out in tears
There was no need to speak the rest
No need to quiet any fears
Of her who askd no reason why
But turnd on me her quiet eye
Yet more than worthy of the love
My spirit struggled with and strove
When on the mountain peak alone
Ambition lent it a new tone
I had no being but in thee
The world and all it did contain
In the earth the air the sea
Its joy its little lot of pain
That was new pleasure the ideal
Dim vanities of dreams by night
And dimmer nothings which were real
Shadows and a more shadowy light
Parted upon their misty wings
And so confusedly became
Thine image and a name a name
Two separate yet most intimate things
I was ambitious have you known
The passion father You have not
A cottager I markd a throne
Of half the world as all my own
And murmurd at such lowly lot
But just like any other dream
Upon the vapour of the dew
My own had past did not the beam
Of beauty which did while it thro
The minute the hour the day oppress
My mind with double loveliness
We walkd together on the crown
Of a high mountain which lookd down
Afar from its proud natural towers
Of rock and forest on the hills
The dwindled hills begirt with bowers
And shouting with a thousand rills
I spoke to her of power and pride
But mystically in such guise
That she might deem it nought beside
The moments converse in her eyes
I read perhaps too carelessly
A mingled feeling with my own
The flush on her bright cheek to me
Seemd to become a queenly throne
Too well that I should let it be
Light in the wilderness alone
I wrappd myself in grandeur then
And donnd a visionary crown
Yet it was not that Fantasy
Had thrown her mantle over me
But that among the rabble men
Lion ambition is chained down
And crouches to a keepers hand
Not so in deserts where the grand
The wild the terrible conspire
With their own breath to fan his fire
Look round thee now on Samarcand
Is not she queen of Earth her pride
Above all cities in her hand
Their destinies in all beside
Of glory which the world hath known
Stands she not nobly and alone
Falling her veriest steppingstone
Shall form the pedestal of a throne
And who her sovereign Timour he
Whom the astonished people saw
Striding oer empires haughtily
A diademd outlaw
O human love thou spirit given
On Earth of all we hope in Heaven
Which fallst into the soul like rain
Upon the Sirocwitherd plain
And failing in thy power to bless
But leavst the heart a wilderness
Idea which bindest life around
With music of so strange a sound
And beauty of so wild a birth
Farewell for I have won the Earth
When Hope the eagle that towerd could see
No cliff beyond him in the sky
His pinions were bent droopingly
And homeward turnd his softend eye
Twas sunset when the sun will part
There comes a sullenness of heart
To him who still would look upon
The glory of the summer sun
That soul will hate the evning mist
So often lovely and will list
To the sound of the coming darkness known
To those whose spirits hearken as one
Who in a dream of night would fly
But cannot from a danger nigh
What tho the moon the white moon
Shed all the splendour of her noon
Her smile is chilly and her beam
In that time of dreariness will seem
So like you gather in your breath
A portrait taken after death
And boyhood is a summer sun
Whose waning is the dreariest one
For all we live to know is known
And all we seek to keep hath flown
Let life then as the dayflower fall
With the noonday beauty which is all
I reachd my home my home no more
For all had flown who made it so
I passd from out its mossy door
And tho my tread was soft and low
A voice came from the threshold stone
Of one whom I had earlier known
O I defy thee Hell to show
On beds of fire that burn below
A humbler heart a deeper woe
Father I firmly do believe
I know for Death who comes for me
From regions of the blest afar
Where there is nothing to deceive
Hath left his iron gate ajar
And rays of truth you cannot see
Are flashing thro Eternity
I do believe that Eblis hath
A snare in every human path
Else how when in the holy grove
I wandered of the idol Love
Who daily scents his snowy wings
With incense of burnt offerings
From the most unpolluted things
Whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven
Above with trellisd rays from Heaven
No mote may shun no tiniest fly
The lightning of his eagle eye
How was it that Ambition crept
Unseen amid the revels there
Till growing bold he laughed and leapt
In the tangles of Loves very hair
I
Hear the sledges with the bells
Silver bells
What a world of merriment their melody foretells
How they tinkle tinkle tinkle
In the icy air of night
While the stars that oversprinkle
All the heavens seem to twinkle
With a crystalline delight
Keeping time time time
In a sort of Runic rhyme
To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells
From the bells bells bells bells
Bells bells bells
From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells
II
Hear the mellow wedding bells
Golden bells
What a world of happiness their harmony foretells
Through the balmy air of night
How they ring out their delight
From the moltengolden notes
And an in tune
What a liquid ditty floats
To the turtledove that listens while she gloats
On the moon
Oh from out the sounding cells
What a gush of euphony voluminously wells
How it swells
How it dwells
On the Future how it tells
Of the rapture that impels
To the swinging and the ringing
Of the bells bells bells
Of the bells bells bellsbells
Bells bells bells
To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells
III
Hear the loud alarum bells
Brazen bells
What a tale of terror now their turbulency tells
In the startled ear of night
How they scream out their affright
Too much horrified to speak
They can only shriek shriek
Out of tune
In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire
In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire
Leaping higher higher higher
With a desperate desire
And a resolute endeavor
Now now to sit or never
By the side of the palefaced moon
Oh the bells bells bells
What a tale their terror tells
Of Despair
How they clang and clash and roar
What a horror they outpour
On the bosom of the palpitating air
Yet the ear it fully knows
By the twanging
And the clanging
How the danger ebbs and flows
Yet the ear distinctly tells
In the jangling
And the wrangling
How the danger sinks and swells
By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells
Of the bells
Of the bells bells bellsbells
Bells bells bells
In the clamor and the clangor of the bells
IV
Hear the tolling of the bells
Iron Bells
What a world of solemn thought their monody compels
In the silence of the night
How we shiver with affright
At the melancholy menace of their tone
For every sound that floats
From the rust within their throats
Is a groan
And the people ah the people
They that dwell up in the steeple
All Alone
And who tolling tolling tolling
In that muffled monotone
Feel a glory in so rolling
On the human heart a stone
They are neither man nor woman
They are neither brute nor human
They are Ghouls
And their king it is who tolls
And he rolls rolls rolls
Rolls
A paean from the bells
And his merry bosom swells
With the paean of the bells
And he dances and he yells
Keeping time time time
In a sort of Runic rhyme
To the paean of the bells
Of the bells
Keeping time time time
In a sort of Runic rhyme
To the throbbing of the bells
Of the bells bells bells
To the sobbing of the bells
Keeping time time time
As he knells knells knells
In a happy Runic rhyme
To the rolling of the bells
Of the bells bells bells
To the tolling of the bells
Of the bells bells bells bells
Bells bells bells
To the moaning and the groaning of the bells
The bells ah the bells
The little silver bells
How fairylike a melody there floats
From their throats
From their merry little throats
From the silver tinkling throats
Of the bells bells bells
Of the bells
The bells ah the bells
The heavy iron bells
How horrible a monody there floats
From their throats
From their deeptoned throats
From their melancholy throats
How I shudder at the notes
Of the bells bells bells
Of the bells
Lo Death has reared himself a throne
In a strange city lying alone
Far down within the dim West
Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best
Have gone to their eternal rest
There shrines and palaces and towers
Timeeaten towers that tremble not
Resemble nothing that is ours
Around by lifting winds forgot
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters he
No rays from the holy heaven come down
On the long nighttime of that town
But light from out the lurid sea
Streams up the turrets silently
Gleams up the pinnacles far and free
Up domes up spires up kingly halls
Up fanes up Babylonlike walls
Up shadowy longforgotten bowers
Of sculptured ivy and stone flowers
Up many and many a marvellous shrine
Whose wreathed friezes intertwine
The viol the violet and the vine
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie
So blend the turrets and shadows there
That all seem pendulous in air
While from a proud tower in the town
Death looks gigantically down
There open fanes and gaping graves
Yawn level with the luminous waves
But not the riches there that lie
In each idols diamond eye
Not the gailyjewelled dead
Tempt the waters from their bed
For no ripples curl alas
Along that wilderness of glass
No swellings tell that winds may be
Upon some faroff happier sea
No heavings hint that winds have been
On seas less hideously serene
But lo a stir is in the air
The wave there is a movement there
As if the towers had thrust aside
In slightly sinking the dull tide
As if their tops had feebly given
A void within the filmy Heaven
The waves have now a redder glow
The hours are breathing faint and low
And when amid no earthly moans
Down down that town shall settle hence
Hell rising from a thousand thrones
Shall do it reverence
LO Death hath reard himself a throne
In a strange city all alone
Far down within the dim west
Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best
Have gone to their eternal rest

There shrines and palaces and towers
Are not like any thing of ours
Oh no O no ours never loom
To heaven with that ungodly gloom
Timeeaten towers that tremble not
Resemble nothing that is ours
Around by lifting winds forgot
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie

No holy rays from heaven come down
On the long nighttime of that town
But light from out the lurid sea
Streams up the turrets silently
Up thrones up longforgotten bowers
Of sculturd ivy and stone flowers
Up domes up spires up kingly halls
Up fanes up Babylonlike walls
Up many a melancholy shrine
Whose entablatures intertwine
The mask the viol and the vine

There open temples open graves
Are on a level with the waves
But not the riches there that lie
In each idols diamond eye
Not the gailyjewelld dead
Tempt the waters from their bed
For no ripples curl alas
Along that wilderness of glass
No swellings hint that winds may be
Upon a faroff happier sea
So blend the turrets and shadows there
That all seem pendulous in air
While from the high towers of the town
Death looks gigantically down

But lo a stir is in the air
The wave there is a ripple there
As if the towers had thrown aside
In slightly sinking the dull tide
As if the turrettops had given
A vacuum in the filmy heaven
The waves have now a redder glow
The very hours are breathing low
And when amid no earthly moans
Down down that town shall settle hence
All Hades from a thousand thrones
Shall do it reverence
And Death to some more happy clime
Shall give his undivided time
Type of the antique Rome Rich reliquary
Of lofty contemplation left to Time
By buried centuries of pomp and power
At length at length after so many days
Of weary pilgrimage and burning thirst
Thirst for the springs of lore that in thee lie
I kneel an altered and an humble man
Amid thy shadows and so drink within
My very soul thy grandeur gloom and glory
Vastness and Age and Memories of Eld
Silence and Desolation and dim Night
I feel ye now I feel ye in your strength
O spells more sure than eer Judaean king
Taught in the gardens of Gethsemane
O charms more potent than the rapt Chaldee
Ever drew down from out the quiet stars
Here where a hero fell a column falls
Here where the mimic eagle glared in gold
A midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat
Here where the dames of Rome their gilded hair
Waved to the wind now wave the reed and thistle
Here where on golden throne the monarch lolled
Glides spectrelike unto his marble home
Lit by the wan light of the horned moon
The swift and silent lizard of the stones
But stay these walls these ivyclad arcades
These moldering plinths these sad and blackened shafts
These vague entablatures this crumbling frieze
These shattered cornices this wreck this ruin
These stones alas these grey stones are they all
All of the famed and the colossal left
By the corrosive Hours to Fate and me
Not all the Echoes answer me not all
Prophetic sounds and loud arise forever
From us and from all Ruin unto the wise
As melody from Memnon to the Sun
We rule the hearts of mightiest men we rule
With a despotic sway all giant minds
We are not impotent we pallid stones
Not all our power is gone not all our fame
Not all the magic of our high renown
Not all the wonder that encircles us
Not all the mysteries that in us lie
Not all the memories that hang upon
And cling around about us as a garment
Clothing us in a robe of more than glory
Lo tis a gala night
Within the lonesome latter years
An angel throng bewinged bedight
In veils and drowned in tears
Sit in a theatre to see
A play of hopes and fears
While the orchestra breathes fitfully
The music of the spheres
Mimes in the form of God on high
Mutter and mumble low
And hither and thither fly
Mere puppets they who come and go
At bidding of vast formless things
That shift the scenery to and fro
Flapping from out their Condor wings
Invisible Woe
That motley drama oh be sure
It shall not be forgot
With its Phantom chased for evermore
By a crowd that seize it not
Through a circle that ever returneth in
To the selfsame spot
And much of Madness and more of Sin
And Horror the soul of the plot
But see amid the mimic rout
A crawling shape intrude
A bloodred thing that writhes from out
The scenic solitude
It writhes it writhes with mortal pangs
The mimes become its food
And seraphs sob at vermin fangs
In human gore imbued
Out out are the lights out all
And over each quivering form
The curtain a funeral pall
Comes down with the rush of a storm
While the angels all pallid and wan
Uprising unveiling affirm
That the play is the tragedy Man
And its hero the Conqueror Worm
The only king by right divine
Is Ellen King and were she mine
Id strive for liberty no more
But hug the glorious chains I wore
Her bosom is an ivory throne
Where tyrant virtue reigns alone
No subject vice dare interfere
To check the power that governs here
O would she deign to rule my fate
Id worship Kings and kingly state
And hold this maxim all life long
The King my King can do no wrong
Tis said that when
The hands of men
Tamed this primeval wood
And hoary trees with groans of woe
Like warriors by an unknown foe
Were in their strength subdued
The virgin Earth Gave instant birth
To springs that neer did flow
That in the sun Did rivulets run
And all around rare flowers did blow
The wild rose pale Perfumed the gale
And the queenly lily adown the dale
Whom the sun and the dew
And the winds did woo
With the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew
So when in tears
The love of years
Is wasted like the snow
And the fine fibrils of its life
By the rude wrong of instant strife
Are broken at a blow
Within the heart
Do springs upstart
Of which it doth now know
And strange sweet dreams
Like silent streams
That from new fountains overflow
With the earlier tide
Of rivers glide
Deep in the heart whose hope has died
Quenching the fires its ashes hide
Its ashes whence will spring and grow
Sweet flowers ere long
The rare and radiant flowers of song
The happiest day the happiest hour
My seard and blighted heart hath known
The highest hope of pride and power
I feel hath flown
Of power said I yes such I ween
But they have vanishd long alas
The visions of my youth have been
But let them pass
And pride what have I now with thee
Another brow may even inherit
The venom thou hast pourd on me
Be still my spirit
The happiest day the happiest hour
Mine eyes shall see have ever seen
The brightest glance of pride and power
I feel have been
But were that hope of pride and power
Now offerd with the pain
Even then I felt that brightest hour
I would not live again
For on its wing was dark alloy
And as it flutterd fell
An essence powerful to destroy
A soul that knew it well
In the greenest of our valleys
By good angels tenanted
Once a fair and stately palace
Radiant palace reared its head
In the monarch Thoughts dominion
It stood there
Never seraph spread a pinion
Over fabric half so fair
Banners yellow glorious golden
On its roof did float and flow
This all this was in the olden
Time long ago
And every gentle air that dallied
In that sweet day
Along the ramparts plumed and pallid
A winged odor went away
Wanderers in that happy valley
Through two luminous windows saw
Spirits moving musically
To a lutes welltuned law
Round about a throne where sitting
Porphyrogene
In state his glory wellbefitting
The ruler of the realm was seen
And all with pearl and ruby glowing
Was the fair palace door
Through which came flowing flowing flowing
And sparkling evermore
A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty
Was but to sing
In voices of surpassing beauty
The wit and wisdom of their king
But evil things in robes of sorrow
Assailed the monarchs high estate
Ah let us mourn for never morrow
Shall dawn upon him desolate
And round about his home the glory
That blushed and bloomed
Is but a dimremembered story
Of the old time entombed
And travellers now within that valley
Through the redlitten windows see
Vast forms that move fantastically
To a discordant melody
While like a ghastly rapid river
Through the pale door
A hideous throng rush out forever
And laugh but smile no more
THE END

In spring of youth it was my lot
To haunt of the wide world a spot
The which I could not love the less
So lovely was the loneliness
Of a wild lake with black rock bound
And the tall pines that towered around
But when the Night had thrown her pall
Upon that spot as upon all
And the mystic wind went by
Murmuring in melody
Then ah then I would awake
To the terror of the lone lake
Yet that terror was not fright
But a tremulous delight
A feeling not the jewelled mine
Could teach or bribe me to define
Nor Love although the Love were thine
Death was in that poisonous wave
And in its gulf a fitting grave
For him who thence could solace bring
To his lone imagining
Whose solitary soul could make
An Eden of that dim lake
Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered weak and weary
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore
While I nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping
As of some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber door
Tis some visitor I muttered tapping at my chamber door
Only this and nothing more
Ah distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
Eagerly I wished the morrow vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow sorrow for the lost Lenore
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore
Nameless here for evermore
And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before
So that now to still the beating of my heart I stood repeating
Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door
This it is and nothing more
Presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer
Sir said I or Madam truly your forgiveness I implore
But the fact is I was napping and so gently you came rapping
And so faintly you came tapping tapping at my chamber door
That I scarce was sure I heard you here I opened wide the door
Darkness there and nothing more
Deep into that darkness peering long I stood there wondering
fearing
Doubting dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before
But the silence was unbroken and the stillness gave no token
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word Lenore
This I whispered and an echo murmured back the word Lenore
Merely this and nothing more
Back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before
Surely said I surely that is something at my window lattice
Let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore
Tis the wind and nothing more
Open here I flung the shutter when with many a flirt and
flutter
In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore
Not the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed
he
But with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door
Perched and sat and nothing more
Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore
Though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou I said art sure no
craven
Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Nights Plutonian shore
Quoth the Raven Nevermore
Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly
Though its answer little meaning little relevancy bore
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door
With such name as Nevermore
But the raven sitting lonely on the placid bust spoke only
That one word as if his soul in that one word he did outpour
Nothing further then he uttered not a feather then he fluttered
Till I scarcely more than muttered other friends have flown
before
On the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before
Then the bird said Nevermore
Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken
Doubtless said I what it utters is its only stock and store
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
Of Never nevermore
But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and
door
Then upon the velvet sinking I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore
What this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore
Meant in croaking Nevermore
This I sat engaged in guessing but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms core
This and more I sat divining with my head at ease reclining
On the cushions velvet lining that the lamplight gloated oer
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating oer
She shall press ah nevermore
Then methought the air grew denser perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor
Wretch I cried thy God hath lent thee by these angels he
hath sent thee
Respite respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore
Quaff oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore
Quoth the Raven Nevermore
Prophet said I thing of evil prophet still if bird or
devil
Whether Tempter sent or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore
Desolate yet all undaunted on this desert land enchanted
On this home by horror haunted tell me truly I implore
Is there is there balm in Gilead tell me tell me I implore
Quoth the Raven Nevermore
Prophet said I thing of evil prophet still if bird or
devil
By that Heaven that bends above us by that God we both adore
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if within the distant Aidenn
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore
Quoth the Raven Nevermore
Be that word our sign in parting bird or fiend I shrieked
upstarting
Get thee back into the tempest and the Nights Plutonian shore
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken
Leave my loneliness unbroken quit the bust above my door
Take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my
door
Quoth the Raven Nevermore
And the Raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming
And the lamplight oer him streaming throws his shadow on the
floor
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifted nevermore
At midnight in the month of June
I stand beneath the mystic moon
An opiate vapor dewy dim
Exhales from out her golden rim
And softly dripping drop by drop
Upon the quiet mountain top
Steals drowsily and musically
Into the universal valley
The rosemary nods upon the grave
The lily lolls upon the wave
Wrapping the fog about its breast
The ruin molders into rest
Looking like Lethe see the lake
A conscious slumber seems to take
And would not for the world awake
All Beauty sleeps and lo where lies
Irene with her Destinies
O lady bright can it be right
This window open to the night
The wanton airs from the treetop
Laughingly through the lattice drop
The bodiless airs a wizard rout
Flit through thy chamber in and out
And wave the curtain canopy
So fitfully so fearfully
Above the closed and fringed lid
Neath which thy slumbring soul lies hid
That oer the floor and down the wall
Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall
Oh lady dear hast thou no fear
Why and what art thou dreaming here
Sure thou art come Oer faroff seas
A wonder to these garden trees
Strange is thy pallor strange thy dress
Strange above all thy length of tress
And this all solemn silentness
The lady sleeps Oh may her sleep
Which is enduring so be deep
Heaven have her in its sacred keep
This chamber changed for one more holy
This bed for one more melancholy
I pray to God that she may lie
For ever with unopened eye
While the pale sheeted ghosts go by
My love she sleeps Oh may her sleep
As it is lasting so be deep
Soft may the worms about her creep
Far in the forest dim and old
For her may some tall vault unfold
Some vault that oft has flung its black
And winged panels fluttering back
Triumphant oer the crested palls
Of her grand family funerals
Some sepulchre remote alone
Against whose portal she hath thrown
In childhood many an idle stone
Some tomb from out whose sounding door
She neer shall force an echo more
Thrilling to think poor child of sin
It was the dead who groaned within
Once it smiled a silent dell
Where the people did not dwell
They had gone unto the wars
Trusting to the mildeyed stars
Nightly from their azure towers
To keep watch above the flowers
In the midst of which all day
The red sunlight lazily lay
Now each visitor shall confess
The sad valleys restlessness
Nothing there is motionless
Nothing save the airs that brood
Over the magic solitude
Ah by no wind are stirred those trees
That palpitate like the chill seas
Around the misty Hebrides
Ah by no wind those clouds are driven
That rustle through the unquiet Heaven
Uneasily from morn till even
Over the violets there that lie
In myriad types of the human eye
Over the lilies there that wave
And weep above a nameless grave
They wave from out their fragrant tops
Eternal dews come down in drops
They weep from off their delicate stems
Perennial tears descend in gems
In these rapid restless shadows
Once I walked at eventide
When a gentle silent maiden
Walked in beauty at my side
She alone there walked beside me
All in beauty like a bride
Pallidly the moon was shining
On the dewy meadows nigh
On the silvery silent rivers
On the mountains far and high
On the oceans starlit waters
Where the winds aweary die
Slowly silently we wandered
From the open cottage door
Underneath the elms long branches
To the pavement bending oer
Underneath the mossy willow
And the dying sycamore
With the myriad stars in beauty
All bedight the heavens were seen
Radiant hopes were bright around me
Like the light of stars serene
Like the mellow midnight splendor
Of the Nights irradiate queen
Audibly the elmleaves whispered
Peaceful pleasant melodies
Like the distant murmured music
Of unquiet lovely seas
While the winds were hushed in slumber
In the fragrant flowers and trees
Wondrous and unwonted beauty
Still adorning all did seem
While I told my love in fables
Neath the willows by the stream
Would the heart have kept unspoken
Love that was its rarest dream
Instantly away we wandered
In the shadowy twilight tide
She the silent scornful maiden
Walking calmly at my side
With a step serene and stately
All in beauty all in pride
Vacantly I walked beside her
On the earth mine eyes were cast
Swift and keen there came unto me
Bitter memories of the past
On me like the rain in Autumn
On the dead leaves cold and fast
Underneath the elms we parted
By the lowly cottage door
One brief word alone was uttered
Never on our lips before
And away I walked forlornly
Brokenhearted evermore
Slowly silently I loitered
Homeward in the night alone
Sudden anguish bound my spirit
That my youth had never known
Wild unrest like that which cometh
When the Nights first dream hath flown
Now to me the elmleaves whisper
Mad discordant melodies
And keen melodies like shadows
Haunt the moaning willow trees
And the sycamores with laughter
Mock me in the nightly breeze
Sad and pale the Autumn moonlight
Through the sighing foliage streams
And each morning midnight shadow
Shadow of my sorrow seems
Strive O heart forget thine idol
And O soul forget thy dreams
Not long ago the writer of these lines
In the mad pride of intellectuality
Maintained the power of words denied that ever
A thought arose within the human brain
Beyond the utterance of the human tongue
And now as if in mockery of that boast
Two words two foreign soft dissyllables
Italian tones made only to be murmured
By angels dreaming in the moonlit dew
That hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill
Have stirred from out the abysses of his heart
Unthoughtlike thoughts that are the souls of thought
Richer far wilder far diviner visions
Than even seraph harper Israfel
Who has the sweetest voice of all Gods creatures
Could hope to utter And I my spells are broken
The pen falls powerless from my shivering hand
With thy dear name as text though bidden by thee
I cannot write I cannot speak or think
Alas I cannot feel for tis not feeling
This standing motionless upon the golden
Threshold of the wideopen gate of dreams
Gazing entranced adown the gorgeous vista
And thrilling as I see upon the right
Upon the left and all the way along
Amid empurpled vapors far away
To where the prospect terminates thee only
Thou wouldst be loved then let thy heart
From its present pathway part not
Being everything which now thou art
Be nothing which thou art not
So with the world thy gentle ways
Thy grace thy more than beauty
Shall be an endless theme of praise
And love a simple duty
Beloved amid the earnest woes
That crowd around my earthly path
Drear path alas where grows
Not even one lonely rose
My soul at least a solace hath
In dreams of thee and therein knows
An Eden of bland repose
And thus thy memory is to me
Like some enchanted faroff isle
In some tumultuous sea
Some ocean throbbing far and free
With storms but where meanwhile
Serenest skies continually
Just oer that one bright island smile
I saw thee once once only years ago
I must not say how many but not many
It was a July midnight and from out
A fullorbed moon that like thine own soul soaring
Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven
There fell a silverysilken veil of light
With quietude and sultriness and slumber
Upon the upturned faces of a thousand
Roses that grew in an enchanted garden
Where no wind dared to stir unless on tiptoe
Fell on the upturnd faces of these roses
That gave out in return for the lovelight
Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death
Fell on the upturnd faces of these roses
That smiled and died in this parterre enchanted
By thee and by the poetry of thy presence
Clad all in white upon a violet bank
I saw thee half reclining while the moon
Fell on the upturnd faces of the roses
And on thine own upturnd alas in sorrow
Was it not Fate that on this July midnight
Was it not Fate whose name is also Sorrow
That bade me pause before that gardengate
To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses
No footstep stirred the hated world an slept
Save only thee and me Oh Heaven oh God
How my heart beats in coupling those two words
Save only thee and me I paused I looked
And in an instant all things disappeared
Ah bear in mind this garden was enchanted
The pearly lustre of the moon went out
The mossy banks and the meandering paths
The happy flowers and the repining trees
Were seen no more the very roses odors
Died in the arms of the adoring airs
All all expired save thee save less than thou
Save only the divine light in thine eyes
Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes
I saw but them they were the world to me
I saw but them saw only them for hours
Saw only them until the moon went down
What wild hearthistories seemed to he enwritten
Upon those crystalline celestial spheres
How dark a woe yet how sublime a hope
How silently serene a sea of pride
How daring an ambition yet how deep
How fathomless a capacity for love
But now at length dear Dian sank from sight
Into a western couch of thundercloud
And thou a ghost amid the entombing trees
Didst glide away Only thine eyes remained
They would not go they never yet have gone
Lighting my lonely pathway home that night
They have not left me as my hopes have since
They follow me they lead me through the years
They are my ministers yet I their slave
Their office is to illumine and enkindle
My duty to be saved by their bright light
And purified in their electric fire
And sanctified in their elysian fire
They fill my soul with Beauty which is Hope
And are far up in Heaven the stars I kneel to
In the sad silent watches of my night
While even in the meridian glare of day
I see them still two sweetly scintillant
Venuses unextinguished by the sun
Helen thy beauty is to me
Like those Nicean barks of yore
That gently oer a perfumed sea
The weary wayworn wanderer bore
To his own native shore
On desperate seas long wont to roam
Thy hyacinth hair thy classic face
Thy Naiad airs have brought me home
To the glory that was Greece
And the grandeur that was Rome
Lo in yon brilliant windowniche
How statuelike I see thee stand
The agate lamp within thy hand
Ah Psyche from the regions which
Are Holy Land
I Beneath the vineclad eaves
Whose shadows fall before
Thy lowly cottage door
Under the lilacs tremulous leaves
Within thy snowy clasped hand
The purple flowers it bore
Last eve in dreams I saw thee stand
Like queenly nymph from Fairyland
Enchantress of the flowery wand
Most beauteous Isadore
II And when I bade the dream
Upon thy spirit flee
Thy violet eyes to me
Upturned did overflowing seem
With the deep untold delight
Of Loves serenity
Thy classic brow like lilies white
And pale as the Imperial Night
Upon her throne with stars bedight
Enthralled my soul to thee
III Ah ever I behold
Thy dreamy passionate eyes
Blue as the languid skies
Hung with the sunsets fringe of gold
Now strangely clear thine image grows
And olden memories
Are startled from their long repose
Like shadows on the silent snows
When suddenly the nightwind blows
Where quiet moonlight lies
IV Like music heard in dreams
Like strains of harps unknown
Of birds for ever flown
Audible as the voice of streams
That murmur in some leafy dell
I hear thy gentlest tone
And Silence cometh with her spell
Like that which on my tongue doth dwell
When tremulous in dreams I tell
My love to thee alone
V In every valley heard
Floating from tree to tree
Less beautiful to me
The music of the radiant bird
Than artless accents such as thine
Whose echoes never flee
Ah how for thy sweet voice I pine
For uttered in thy tones benign
Enchantress this rude name of mine
Doth seem a melody
Of all who hail thy presence as the morning
Of all to whom thine absence is the night
The blotting utterly from out high heaven
The sacred sun of all who weeping bless thee
Hourly for hope for life ah above all
For the resurrection of deepburied faith
In Truth in Virtue in Humanity
Of all who on Despairs unhallowed bed
Lying down to die have suddenly arisen
At thy softmurmured words Let there be light
At the softmurmured words that were fulfilled
In the seraphic glancing of thine eyes
Of all who owe thee most whose gratitude
Nearest resembles worship oh remember
The truest the most fervently devoted
And think that these weak lines are written by him
By him who as he pens them thrills to think
His spirit is communing with an angels
O I care not that my earthly lot
Hath little of Earth in it
That years of love have been forgot
In the fever of a minute
I heed not that the desolate
Are happier sweet than I
But that you meddle with my fate
Who am a passer by
It is not that my founts of bliss
Are gushing strange with tears
Or that the thrill of a single kiss
Hath palsied many years
Tis not that the flowers of twenty springs
Which have witherd as they rose
Lie dead on my heartstrings
With the weight of an age of snows
Not that the grass O may it thrive
On my grave is growing or grown
But that while I am dead yet alive
I cannot be lady alone
Of all who hail thy presence as the morning
Of all to whom thine absence is the night
The blotting utterly from out high heaven
The sacred sun of all who weeping bless thee
Hourly for hope for life ah above all
For the resurrection of deepburied faith
In Truth in Virtue in Humanity
Of all who on Despairs unhallowed bed
Lying down to die have suddenly arisen
At thy softmurmured words Let there be light
At the softmurmured words that were fulfilled
In the seraphic glancing of thine eyes
Of all who owe thee most whose gratitude
Nearest resembles worship oh remember
The truest the most fervently devoted
And think that these weak lines are written by him
By him who as he pens them thrills to think
His spirit is communing with an angels
Because I feel that in the Heavens above
The angels whispering to one another
Can find among their burning terms of love
None so devotional as that of Mother
Therefore by that dear name I long have called you
You who are more than mother unto me
And fill my heart of hearts where Death installed you
In setting my Virginias spirit free
My mother my own mother who died early
Was but the mother of myself but you
Are mother to the one I loved so dearly
And thus are dearer than the mother I knew
By that infinity with which my wife
Was dearer to my soul than its soullife
Seraph thy memory is to me
Like some enchanted faroff isle
In some tumultuous sea
Some ocean vexed as it may be
With storms but where meanwhile
Serenest skies continually
Just oer that one bright island smile
For mid the earnest cares and woes
That crowd around my earthly path
Sad path alas where grows
Not even one lonely rose
My soul at least a solace hath
In dreams of thee and therein knows
An Eden of bland repose
Thou wast all that to me love
For which my soul did pine
A green isle in the sea love
A fountain and a shrine
All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers
And all the flowers were mine
Ah dream too bright to last
Ah starry Hope that didst arise
But to be overcast
A voice from out the Future cries
On on but oer the Past
Dim gulf my spirit hovering lies
Mute motionless aghast
For alas alas me
For me the light of Life is over
No more no more no more
Such language holds the solemn sea
To the sands upon the shore
Shall bloom the thunderblasted tree
Or the stricken eagle soar
And all my days are trances
And all my nightly dreams
Are where thy grey eye glances
And where thy footstep gleams
In what ethereal dances
By what eternal streams
Fair river in thy bright clear flow
Of crystal wandering water
Thou art an emblem of the glow
Of beauty the unhidden heart
The playful maziness of art
In old Albertos daughter
But when within thy wave she looks
Which glistens then and trembles
Why then the prettiest of brooks
Her worshipper resembles
For in his heart as in thy stream
Her image deeply lies
His heart which trembles at the beam
Of her soulsearching eyes
The skies they were ashen and sober
The leaves they were crisped and sere
The leaves they were withering and sere
It was night in the lonesome October
Of my most immemorial year
It was hard by the dim lake of Auber
In the misty mid region of Weir
It was down by the dank tarn of Auber
In the ghoulhaunted woodland of Weir
Here once through an alley Titanic
Of cypress I roamed with my Soul
Of cypress with Psyche my Soul
There were days when my heart was volcanic
As the scoriac rivers that roll
As the lavas that restlessly roll
Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek
In the ultimate climes of the pole
That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek
In the realms of the boreal pole
Our talk had been serious and sober
But our thoughts they were palsied and sere
Our memories were treacherous and sere
For we knew not the month was October
And we marked not the night of the year
Ah night of all nights in the year
We noted not the dim lake of Auber
Though once we had journeyed down here
Remembered not the dank tarn of Auber
Nor the ghoulhaunted woodland of Weir
And now as the night was senescent
And stardials pointed to morn
As the stardials hinted of morn
At the end of our path a liquescent
And nebulous lustre was born
Out of which a miraculous crescent
Arose with a duplicate horn
Astartes bediamonded crescent
Distinct with its duplicate horn
And I said She is warmer than Dian
She rolls through an ether of sighs
She revels in a region of sighs
She has seen that the tears are not dry on
These cheeks where the worm never dies
And has come past the stars of the Lion
To point us the path to the skies
To the Lethean peace of the skies
Come up in despite of the Lion
To shine on us with her bright eyes
Come up through the lair of the Lion
With love in her luminous eyes
But Psyche uplifting her finger
Said Sadly this star I mistrust
Her pallor I strangely mistrust
Oh hasten oh let us not linger
Oh fly let us fly for we must
In terror she spoke letting sink her
Wings until they trailed in the dust
In agony sobbed letting sink her
Plumes till they trailed in the dust
Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust
I replied This is nothing but dreaming
Let us on by this tremulous light
Let us bathe in this crystalline light
Its Sybilic splendor is beaming
With Hope and in Beauty tonight
See it flickers up the sky through the night
Ah we safely may trust to its gleaming
And be sure it will lead us aright
We safely may trust to a gleaming
That cannot but guide us aright
Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night
Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her
And tempted her out of her gloom
And conquered her scruples and gloom
And we passed to the end of the vista
But were stopped by the door of a tomb
By the door of a legended tomb
And I said What is written sweet sister
On the door of this legended tomb
She replied Ulalume Ulalume
Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume
Then my heart it grew ashen and sober
As the leaves that were crisped and sere
As the leaves that were withering and sere
And I cried It was surely October
On this very night of last year
That I journeyed I journeyed down here
That I brought a dread burden down here
On this night of all nights in the year
Ah what demon has tempted me here
Well I know now this dim lake of Auber
This misty mid region of Weir
Well I know now this dank tarn of Auber
This ghoulhaunted woodland of Weir
The bowers whereat in dreams I see
The wantonest singing birds
Are lips and all thy melody
Of lipbegotten words
Thine eyes in Heaven of heart enshrined
Then desolately fall
O God on my funereal mind
Like starlight on a pall
Thy heart thy heart I wake and sigh
And sleep to dream till day
Of the truth that gold can never buy
Of the baubles that it may
The skies they were ashen and sober
The leaves they were crisped and sere
The leaves they were withering and sere
It was night in the lonesome October
Of my most immemorial year
It was hard by the dim lake of Auber
In the misty mid region of Weir
It was down by the dank tarn of Auber
In the ghoulhaunted woodland of Weir
Here once through an alley Titanic

Of cypress with Psyche my Soul
